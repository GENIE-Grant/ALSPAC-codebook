  abstract = {By characterizing the geographic and functional spectrum of human genetic variation, the 1000 Genomes Project aims to build a resource to help to understand the genetic contribution to disease. Here we describe the genomes of 1,092 individuals from 14 populations, constructed using a combination of low-coverage whole-genome and exome sequencing. By developing methods to integrate information across several algorithms and diverse data sources, we provide a validated haplotype map of 38\,million single nucleotide polymorphisms, 1.4\,million short insertions and deletions, and more than 14,000 larger deletions. We show that individuals from different populations carry different profiles of rare and common variants, and that low-frequency variants show substantial geographic differentiation, which is further increased by the action of purifying selection. We show that evolutionary conservation and coding consequence are key determinants of the strength of purifying selection, that rare-variant load varies substantially across biological pathways, and that each individual contains hundreds of rare non-coding variants at conserved sites, such as motif-disrupting changes in transcription-factor-binding sites. This resource, which captures up to 98\% of accessible single nucleotide polymorphisms at a frequency of 1\% in related populations, enables analysis of common and low-frequency variants in individuals from diverse, including admixed, populations.}

  abstract = {Anorexia nervosa (AN) is often associated with physical hyperactivity. Recent studies have established links between anorexia and hyperactivity, suggesting the existence of commonalities in neural pathways. How physical activity should be managed during the clinical care of patients with anorexia remains controversial. This review first focuses on the implication of hyperactivity in the pathophysiology of AN. Hyperactivity during refeeding of patients with AN has been associated with increased energy needs to achieve weight gain, poorer clinical outcome, longer hospitalization, and increased psychiatric comorbidity. This typically leads to the prescription of bed rest. However, current knowledge suggests that preserving some kind of physical activity during refeeding of patients with AN should be safe and beneficial for the restoration of body composition, the preservation of bone mineral density, and the management of mood and anxiety. In the absence of standardized guidelines, it is suggested here that physical activity during refeeding of patients with AN should be personalized according to the physical and mental status of each patient. More research is needed to assess whether programmed physical activity may be a beneficial part of the treatment of AN.}

It also aimed to determine the effect of early adolescent depressive symptoms on the prevalence and trajectory of these different eating disorder symptoms. Participants (N\,=\,1,383; 49\% male) were drawn from the Western Australian Pregnancy Cohort (Raine) Study, a prospective cohort study that has followed participants from pre-birth to age 20 years. An adapted version of the Eating Disorder Examination-Questionnaire was used to assess eating disorder symptoms at ages 14, 17 and 20 years. The Beck Depression Inventory for Youth was used to assess depressive symptoms at age 14. Longitudinal changes in the prevalence of eating disorder symptoms were tested using generalised estimating equations and linear mixed models.},

Objective The study assessed the influence of body dissatisfaction on smoking, cannabis use, drug use, self-harm, gambling, and drinking and the mediating role of disordered eating in a population-based sample of British adolescents. Method Participants were 2634 females and 1684 males from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) cohort. Logistic regression was used to test if body dissatisfaction at 14 years old predicted the onset of risky health behaviours at 21 years old. Mediation analysis tested the mediating role of disordered eating at 16 years old on each risky health behaviour. Results Among females, body dissatisfaction predicted smoking (OR\,=\,1.40, 95\% CI\,=\,1.15, 1.72), cannabis use (OR\,=\,1.20, 95\% CI\,=\,1.00, 1.43), drug use (OR\,=\,1.51, 95\% CI\,=\,1.20, 1.90), self-harm (OR\,=\,1.44, 95\% CI\,=\,1.13, 1.84) and high-risk drinking (OR\,=\,1.41, 95\% CI\,=\,1.10, 1.80). Disordered eating symptoms had mediating effects on some behaviours. Among males, body dissatisfaction predicted smoking (OR\,=\,1.44, 95\% CI\,=\,1.14, 1.81) and no effect of disordered eating was found on any risky health behaviour. Conclusions This is the first prospective study to demonstrate that body dissatisfaction in adolescence predicts the occurrence of several risky health behaviours, and elucidates the mediating role of disordered eating. The findings highlight that body dissatisfaction is a public health concern. Early interventions to promote body satisfaction may reduce the prevalence of later risky health behaviours.},

In mice 2.9, the analysis of imputed data is made completely general, whereas the range of models under which pooling works is substantially extended. mice 2.9 adds new functionality for imputing multilevel data, automatic predictor selection, data handling, post-processing imputed values, specialized pooling routines, model selection tools, and diagnostic graphs. Imputation of categorical data is improved in order to bypass problems caused by perfect prediction. Special attention is paid to transformations, sum scores, indices and interactions using passive imputation, and to the proper setup of the predictor matrix. mice 2.9 can be downloaded from the Comprehensive R Archive Network.

One hundred and twenty-seven women who participated in the exercise program were compared to 127 non-participants on weight gain and self-reported obligatory attitudes and beliefs about exercise. The exercise participants were women who were medically cleared and attended at least two exercise groups during treatment. The control group were women who were medically cleared, but did not attend any exercise groups during treatment. Significant group x diagnosis interactions revealed that women in the exercise group who were diagnosed with anorexia nervosa gained more than one-third as much weight as those in the control group. Also, women in the exercise group demonstrated significantly reduced obligatory attitudes toward exercise compared to the control group. These findings suggest that the use of an exercise program that targets exercise abuse in women with eating disorders is feasible during residential treatment and results in positive change without interfering with weight gain. Limitations that result from the lack of random assignment to the exercise and control group are discussed.},

At age 14, gay and bisexual boys and mostly heterosexual girls reported greater body dissatisfaction than their same-gender heterosexual peers. All sexual minority boys and mostly heterosexual girls reported greater mean dysfunctional eating behaviors than their same-gender heterosexual peers. At age 16, gay and bisexual boys had 12.5 times the odds of heterosexual boys of binge eating; mostly heterosexual boys had over three times the odds of reporting binge eating. Sexual minority girls had over twice the odds of heterosexual girls of purging and binge eating. By mid-adolescence, sexual minority youth in the UK had elevated risk for eating disorder symptoms, suggesting the need for early prevention efforts.}

  abstract = {"Physical activity," "exercise," and "physical fitness" are terms that describe different concepts. However, they are often confused with one another, and the terms are sometimes used interchangeably. This paper proposes definitions to distinguish them. Physical activity is defined as any bodily movement produced by skeletal muscles that results in energy expenditure. The energy expenditure can be measured in kilocalories. Physical activity in daily life can be categorized into occupational, sports, conditioning, household, or other activities. Exercise is a subset of physical activity that is planned, structured, and repetitive and has as a final or an intermediate objective the improvement or maintenance of physical fitness. Physical fitness is a set of attributes that are either health- or skill-related. The degree to which people have these attributes can be measured with specific tests. These definitions are offered as an interpretational framework for comparing studies that relate physical activity, exercise, and physical fitness to health.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Exercise is known to be associated with reduced risk of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular disease, stroke, and diabetes, but its association with mental health remains unclear. We aimed to examine the association between exercise and mental health burden in a large sample, and to better understand the influence of exercise type, frequency, duration, and intensity. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we analysed data from 1 237 194 people aged 18 years or older in the USA from the 2011, 2013, and 2015 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Behavioral Risk Factors Surveillance System survey. We compared the number of days of bad self-reported mental health between individuals who exercised and those who did not, using an exact non-parametric matching procedure to balance the two groups in terms of age, race, gender, marital status, income, education level, body-mass index category, self-reported physical health, and previous diagnosis of depression. We examined the effects of exercise type, duration, frequency, and intensity using regression methods adjusted for potential confounders, and did multiple sensitivity analyses. FINDINGS: Individuals who exercised had 1.49 (43.2\%) fewer days of poor mental health in the past month than individuals who did not exercise but were otherwise matched for several physical and sociodemographic characteristics (W=7.42 x 10(10), p{$<$}2.2 x 10(-16)). All exercise types were associated with a lower mental health burden (minimum reduction of 11.8\% and maximum reduction of 22.3\%) than not exercising (p{$<$}2.2 x 10(-16) for all exercise types). The largest associations were seen for popular team sports (22.3\% lower), cycling (21.6\% lower), and aerobic and gym activities (20.1\% lower), as well as durations of 45 min and frequencies of three to five times per week. INTERPRETATION: In a large US sample, physical exercise was significantly and meaningfully associated with self-reported mental health burden in the past month. More exercise was not always better. Differences as a function of exercise were large relative to other demographic variables such as education and income. Specific types, durations, and frequencies of exercise might be more effective clinical targets than others for reducing mental health burden, and merit interventional study.

To date, no comprehensive theoretical model exists to describe pathological exercise in the context of AN, and as such, few treatments are effective at promoting direct and sustained pathological exercise extinction. Using a framework put forth by Wise \& Koob (2014), debating the relative importance of positive and negative reinforcement in substance use, we present three hypotheses of behavioral reinforcement of exercise, encompassing biological, psychological, and environmental influences. Specifically, we argue that exercise is positively reinforced through receipt of biological and behavioral rewards, negatively reinforced through avoidance of aversive emotions, and that these two systems work in tandem over time to engrain pathological exercise as a habit. We then present suggestions for testing each of these hypotheses as future directions for the field.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The study was aimed at assessing the prevalence of compulsive exercising to control shape and weight in eating disorders (EDs) and its relationship with treatment outcome. METHOD: Compulsive exercising to control shape and weight, defined according to a modified version of the Intense Exercising to Control Shape or Weight section of the Eating Disorder Examination (EDE), was assessed in 165 consecutive ED inpatients entering a protocol based on the transdiagnostic cognitive behavior theory and treatment of EDs. Baseline assessment also included anthropometry, the global EDE interview, the Beck Depression Inventory, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), the Eating Disorders Inventory-Perfectionism Scale, and the Temperament and Character Inventory. RESULTS: Of the patients, 45.5\% were classified as compulsive exercisers, the prevalence being highest (80\%) in restricting-type anorexia nervosa (AN), lowest in EDs not otherwise specified (31.9\%), and intermediate in binge/purging AN (43.3\%) and in purging-type bulimia nervosa (39.3\%). Compulsive exercising to control shape and weight was independently predicted by the EDE restraint score (odds ratio, 1.32; 95\% confidence interval, 1.06-1.64; P = .014) after adjustment for ED; the total amount of exercise was associated with EDE restraint, as well as with the Temperament and Character Inventory reward dependence. At follow-up, an improved EDE global score was predicted by lower baseline values, higher baseline STAI and STAI improvement, and lower amount of exercise in the last 4 weeks. Voluntary treatment discontinuation was not predicted by baseline exercise. DISCUSSION: Compulsive exercising to control shape and weight is a behavioral feature of restricting-type AN, associated with restraint and temperament dimensions, with influence on treatment outcome.},

We hypothesized that GAD but not PD symptoms at the age of 15 years are associated with depression diagnosis at 18 years. METHOD:  Using longitudinal data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) birth cohort we examined relationships of GAD and PD symptoms (measured by the Development and Well-Being Assessment) at 15 years with depression at 18 years (by the Clinical Interview Schedule - Revised) using logistic regression. We excluded adolescents already depressed at 15 years and adjusted for social class, maternal education, birth order, gender, alcohol intake and smoking. We repeated these analyses following multiple imputation for missing data. RESULTS:  In the sample with complete data (n = 2835), high and moderate GAD symptoms in adolescents not depressed at 15 years were associated with increased risk of depression at 18 years both in unadjusted analyses and adjusting for PD symptoms at 15 years and the above potential confounders. The adjusted odds ratio (OR) for depression at 18 years in adolescents with high relative to low GAD scores was 5.2 [95\% confidence interval (CI) 3.0-9.1, overall p {$<$} 0.0001]. There were no associations between PD symptoms and depression at 18 years in any model (high relative to low PD scores, adjusted OR = 1.3, 95\% CI 0.3-4.8, overall p = 0.737). Missing data imputation strengthened the relationship of GAD symptoms with depression (high relative to low GAD scores, OR = 6.2, 95\% CI 3.9-9.9) but those for PD became weaker. CONCLUSIONS:  Symptoms of GAD but not PD at 15 years are associated with depression at 18 years. Clinicians should be aware that adolescents with GAD symptoms may develop depression.}

Obsessive-compulsive personality (OCP) traits are also important risk factors for AN. Since excessive exercise has also been associated with greater obsessionality, we hypothesised that AN patients with a hyperactive behavioural profile represent a phenotype more closely linked to OCD than their non-exercising counterparts. We examined prospectively 50 female AN-Restrictor patients whom we classified as "excessive" or "non-excessive" based on their exercise status i) at admission and ii) over the lifetime of their illness. Validated measures of OCD symptoms and OCP traits were obtained at admission and after refeeding at discharge. On both classification methods, excessive exercisers had greater OCD symptoms and OCP traits than the non-excessive group, but did not differ on body mass index. OCD symptoms, but not OCP traits, decreased between admission and discharge. Findings support our prediction that AN patients with excessive physical activity constitute a subtype of the disorder with strong links to OCD. Indeed, this phenotype may be a culture-bound variant of OCD.},

We studied the trajectories of their development in non-binge eating and non-purging girls during early adolescence. Using a longitudinal design, we assessed 564 girls six times over the three years of middle school (grades 6 through 8) and developed trajectories specifying different developmental patterns in relation to the behaviors. Prior to this period, when the girls were in 5th grade (elementary school), we assessed risk factors to predict girls' subsequent trajectory group membership. Compensatory exercise trajectory groups included a non-engagement group, a group that increased in the behavior, and a group that decreased in the behavior. There were two fasting trajectory groups, one consistently engaging in the behavior and the other consistently not. Elementary school levels of depression, eating expectancies, and thinness expectancies predicted subsequent trajectory group membership. Risk for compensatory exercise and fasting should be evaluated as early as in 5th grade. Targeted interventions should focus on girls in late elementary school or middle school, as this appears to be a critical developmental and maintenance period for compensatory exercise and fasting behavior.},

However, few studies have addressed the issue of prevalence or whether there are different rates of occurrence across diagnostic categories, and the estimates that do exist are not entirely satisfactory. The present study was designed to conduct a detailed examination of the physical activity history in patients with anorexia nervosa (AN) and bulimia nervosa (BN) both during and prior to the onset of their disorder. A sample of adult patients and a second sample of adolescent AN patients took part in the study. A series of chi-square analyses compared diagnostic groups on a number of variables related to sport/exercise behaviors both premorbidly and comorbidly. Data were obtained by means of a detailed structured interview with each patient. We found that a large proportion of eating disorder patients were exercising excessively during an acute phase of the disorder, overexercising is significantly more frequent among those with AN versus BN, and premorbid activity levels significantly predict excessive exercise comorbidity. These findings underscore the centrality of physical activity in the development and maintenance of some eating disorders. They also have important clinical implications in light of the large proportion of individuals who combine dieting and exercise in an attempt to lose weight, and the increasing recognition of the adverse effects of strenuous physical activity in malnourished individuals.},

Hospitalized eating disordered patients and an age-matched control group were assessed. Historical and current physical activity data were collected. An in-depth interview was also conducted to ascertain the age of onset of the diagnostic symptoms for eating disorders, and to determine whether: (               i               ) exercising predated dieting; (               ii               ) patients had been involved in competitive athletics; (               iii               ) exercise was excessive; and (               iv               ) weight loss was inversely related to level of exercise. The results indicated that patients were more physically active than controls from adolescence onwards,               and               prior to the onset of the primary diagnostic criteria for anorexia nervosa. A content analysis of the interview data indicated that 78\% of patients engaged in excessive exercise, 60\% were competitive athletes prior to the onset of their disorder, 60\% reported that sport or exercise pre-dated dieting, and 75\% claimed that physical activity levels steadily increased during the period when food intake and weight loss decreased the most. Together our results suggest that overactivity should not be routinely viewed as a secondary symptom in anorexia nervosa, equivalent to other behaviours. For a number of anorexic women, sport/exercise is an integral part of the pathogenesis and progression of self-starvation.},

The present study tested the prediction that patients with anorexia nervosa (AN) would be more anhedonic than those with bulimia nervosa (BN)-a factor that could contribute to their respective avoidance and approach relationship to food. We also tested the idea that anhedonia would be correlated with high-level exercising from the viewpoint that the latter serves as a compensatory behavior for a blunted affect. AN patients of the restrictor subtype (n = 78) and BN patients with no history of AN (n = 76) were included in the regression analyses. Patients were also classified as excessive exercisers or moderate/nonexercisers according to information gathered during a structured clinical interview. Findings were largely supportive of our predictions. AN patients were highly anhedonic compared to BN patients, and excessive exercisers tended to be more anhedonic than those who did not exercise. We discuss the AN-BN differences in capacity for reward/pleasure in the context of the common psychobiological links between the eating disorders and drug and alcohol addiction, and speculate on how these differences might relate to the etiology and pathophysiology of both AN and BN.},

It also addresses the social conditions that enhance versus diminish these types of motivation, proposing and finding that the degrees to which basic psychological needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness are supported versus thwarted affect both the type and strength of motivation. SDT also examines people's life goals or aspirations, showing differential relations of intrinsic versus extrinsic life goals to performance and psychological health. In this introduction we also briefly discuss recent developments within SDT concerning mindfulness and vitality, and highlight the applicability of SDT within applied domains, including work, relationships, parenting, education, virtual environments, sport, sustainability, health care, and psychotherapy.

Neurotransmitter release, neurotrophic factor and neurogenesis, and cerebral blood flow alteration are some of the concepts involved. In this review, the potential effects of exercise on the aging process and on mental health are discussed, concerning some of the recent findings on animal and human research.

Various underlying causes of LEA have been reported, including disordered eating behavior (DE), but studies investigating the association with exercise addiction and food intolerances are lacking. Therefore, the aim of this crosssectional study was to investigate the association between DE, exercise addiction and food intolerances in athletes at risk of LEA compared to those with low risk. Female endurance athletes, 18\textendash 35 years, training {$\geq$}5 times/week were recruited in Norway, Sweden, Ireland, and Germany. Participants completed an online-survey comprising the LEA in Females Questionnaire (LEAF-Q), Exercise Addiction Inventory (EAI), Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q), and questions regarding food intolerances. Of the 202 participants who met the inclusion criteria and completed the online survey, 65\% were at risk of LEA, 23\% were at risk of exercise addiction, and 21\% had DE. Athletes at risk of LEA had higher EDE-Q and EAI scores compared to athletes with low risk. EAI score remained higher in athletes with risk of LEA after excluding athletes with DE. Athletes at risk of LEA did not report more food intolerances (17 vs. 10\%, P = 0.198), but were more frequently reported by athletes with DE (28 vs. 11\%, P = 0.004). In conclusion, these athletes had a high risk of LEA, exercise addiction, and DE. Exercise addiction should be considered as an additional risk factor in the prevention, early detection, and targeted treatment of RED-S among female endurance athletes.},

METHOD: A sample of children in an ongoing study were recruited to complete in-depth telephone interviews in 1998 on bulimic behaviors (i.e., binge eating and purging). The sample comprised 449 girls and 50 boys. RESULTS: There was some over-reporting of bulimic behaviors on the 1998 questionnaire (asking about 1997-1998) compared with the interview that may have been due to the shorter and nonoverlapping time frame in the interview compared with the questionnaire. Despite the overestimation, the questionnaire did an excellent job at classifying girls who did not purge (negative predictive values [NPV]: 0.99) or binge eat (NPV = 0.98). When purging on the interview was compared with purging on either the 1998 or 1999 questionnaires, the sensitivity increased substantially from 0.73 to 0.93. DISCUSSION: These findings suggest that a short self-report assessment can be used to screen children engaging in, or at risk of beginning to engage in, binge eating and purging.},

These women have been followed over the last 19\textendash 22 years and have completed up to 20 questionnaires, have had detailed data abstracted from their medical records and have information on any cancer diagnoses and deaths through record linkage. A follow-up assessment was completed 17\textendash 18 years postnatal at which anthropometry, blood pressure, fat, lean and bone mass and carotid intima media thickness were assessed, and a fasting blood sample taken. The second follow-up clinic, which additionally measures cognitive function, physical capability, physical activity (with accelerometer) and wrist bone architecture, is underway and two further assessments with similar measurements will take place over the next 5 years. There is a detailed biobank that includes DNA, with genome-wide data available on {$>$}10\,000, stored serum and plasma taken repeatedly since pregnancy and other samples; a wide range of data on completed biospecimen assays are available.

There is little literature, however, examining the relationship between compensatory exercise and thinness expectancies. The goal of the current study was to examine whether thinness expectancies contribute significant variance in the endorsement of excessive exercise over and above binge eating, restraint, and shape and weight concerns. A total of 677 undergraduate women (mean age=18.73) completed self-report measures of thinness expectancies and eating disorder symptoms (TREI and EDE-Q). There was a significant association between thinness expectancies and frequency of compensatory exercise behavior. Restraint and subjective binge episodes accounted for significant variance in compensatory exercise. Frequency of objective binge episodes did not, nor did endorsement of thinness expectancies. These findings suggest a potential profile of individuals engaging in compensatory exercise as individuals who actively restrict their diets, feel as if they have binged when they violate those restrictions, and feel the need to excessively exercise to compensate for the subjective binges.},

To date, there are comprehensive data on approximately 10,000 children and their parents, from early pregnancy until the children are aged between 8 and 9. The study aims to continue to collect detailed data on the children as they go through puberty noting, in particular, changes in anthropometry, attitudes and behaviour, fitness and other cardiovascular risk factors, bone mineralisation, allergic symptoms and mental health. The study started early during pregnancy and collected very detailed data from the mother and her partner before the child was born. This not only provided accurate data on concurrent features, especially medication, symptoms, diet and lifestyle, attitudes and behaviour, social and environmental features, but was unbiased by parental knowledge of any problems that the child might develop. From the time of the child's birth many different aspects of the child's environment have been monitored and a wide range of phenotypic data collected. By virtue of being based in one geographic area, linkage to medical and educational records is relatively simple, and hands-on assessments of children and parents using local facilities has the advantage of high quality control. The comprehensiveness of the ALSPAC approach with a total population sample unselected by disease status, and the availability of parental genotypes, provides an adequate sample for statistical analysis and for avoiding spurious results. The study has an open policy in regard to collaboration within strict confidentiality rules.}

  month = jun,
  abstract = {A transition between states - the above is a simulation of before and after surgery where I've highlighted the large proportion that doesn't improve in the moderate group. As an orthopaedic surgeon I'm often interested in how a patient is doing after surgery compared to before. I call this as a transition between states, e.g. severe pain to moderate pain, and in order to better illustrate these transitions I've created something that I call a transition plot. It's closely related to the plotMat for plotting networks but aimed at less complex relations with only a one-way relation between two groups of states. This project started by me posting a question on Stack Overflow, the answers were (as always) excellent, but didn't really satisfy my needs. What I wanted was a graphically appealing plot that I could control in extreme detail. Thanks to Paul Murrell's excellent grid package I was able to generate a truly customizeable transition plot. In this post I'll give a short introduction with examples to what you can do with the transitionPlot()-function. I'll try to walk you through simple transitions to more complex ones with group proportions and highlighted arrows. Simulate some data To illustrate a simple example we'll generate some data, imagine having a questionnaire for pre- and postoperative pain graded none, moderate, or major. We have the two variables in our data set, and to see the relation we just do a three-by-three table: library(Gmisc) library(Gmisc) \# Generate some fake data set.seed(9730) b4 Transitions None Moderate Major None 13 33 8 Moderate 50 107 30 Major 78 131 50 Simple example This is interpretable, but understanding the flow can be challenging and time-consuming. Visualizing it using the transition plot gives a quick and more intuitive understanding: transitionPlot(transition\_mtrx) Here you can see the thick lines representing the transition from that particular group into the next. So far I've used the graph for the same measure on left and right side but I guess your imagination sets the limit. It can just as well be two or more treatment arms with some discrete outcomes. Simple with a twist In my previous post I documented how I created an arrow that allows perfect control over start, stop and width. Another annoying detail in the default bezier line, is that the arrows are perpendicular to each box, thus not following the line contour as expected. If we change the arrow type to my alternative arrow we get a nicer plot: \# Note that when using my arrow type you need to specify exact unit width \# since I wasn't certain how the lwd should be translated. transitionPlot(transition\_mtrx, overlap\_add\_width = 1.3, type\_of\_arrow = "simple", min\_lwd = unit(2, "mm"), max\_lwd = unit(10, "mm")) Note that I've also added a white background to each arrow in order to visually separate the arrows (the overlay order can be customized with the overlap\_order parameter). To further enhance the transition feeling I have added the option of a color gradient. To do this you need to specify arrow\_type = ``gradient'': \# Note that when using my arrow type you need to specify exact unit width \# since I wasn't certain how the lwd should be translated. transitionPlot(transition\_mtrx, overlap\_add\_width = 1.3, type\_of\_arrow = "gradient", min\_lwd = unit(2, "mm"), max\_lwd = unit(10, "mm")) More complex coloring Additionally you can choose different colors for your boxes: library(RColorBrewer) transitionPlot(transition\_mtrx, txt\_start\_clr = "black", txt\_end\_clr = "black", fill\_start\_box = brewer.pal(n = 3, name = "Pastel1"), fill\_end\_box = brewer.pal(n = 6, name = "Pastel1")[4:6], overlap\_add\_width = 1.3, type\_of\_arrow = "gradient", min\_lwd = unit(2, "mm"), max\_lwd = unit(10, "mm")) Split boxes into proportions Sometimes you might want to split the color of each box into two colors, illustrating a proportion, for instance if we do wrist fracture surgery it might be interesting to explore if the left:right ratio differs. Note that the gradient color is a blend between the two proportions: transitionPlot(transition\_mtrx, box\_prop = cbind(c(0.3, 0.7, 0.5), c(0.5, 0.5, 0.4)), txt\_start\_clr = c("black", "white"), txt\_end\_clr = c("black", "white"), fill\_start\_box = brewer.pal(n = 3, name = "Paired")[1:2], fill\_end\_box = brewer.pal(n = 3, name = "Paired")[1:2], overlap\_add\_width = 1.3, type\_of\_arrow = "gradient", min\_lwd = unit(2, "mm"), max\_lwd = unit(10, "mm")) Highlighting certain arrows Another interesting option may be to highlight a certain transition: arr\_clrs Summary Even though it may seem like a very simple plot, after some tweaking I believe the data-per-ink ratio turns out quite OK. I hope you'll find it as useful as I have. As always, don't hesitate to comment. The function transitionPlot is included in my Gmisc-package.},

Hyperactivity often plays a role in developing and maintaining AN and represents an obstacle to weight gain in refeeding. Interconnections among caloric restriction, psychopathology, and physical activity in humans with AN are poorly investigated. METHODS: Physical activity and food restriction during the last 3 months and status of body image/slimness ideal were assessed by the Structured Interview of Anorexia and Bulimia Nervosa (SIAB) in 30 adolescent patients with acute AN at admission to inpatient treatment. Anxiety, depression, and obsessive-compulsiveness were assessed with the Symptom Check-List-90-Revised (SCL-90-R). A regression model based on the independent variables body mass index, food reduction, body image/slimness ideal, anxiety, depression, and obsessive-compulsiveness was calculated to determine the relevant prediction variables of physical activity. RESULTS: The regression model explained 64\% (R(2) = .64, p = .000) of the variance of physical activity. Only food restriction (p = .006) and anxiety (p = .004) contributed significantly to the variance. DISCUSSION: Our results indicate that anxiety symptoms and food restriction synergistically contribute to increased levels of physical activity in the acute phase of AN.},

  abstract = {Low leptin levels are an endocrinological hallmark of acute anorexia nervosa (AN); a subthreshold leptin secretion in adipocytes as a consequence of a reduced energy intake is presumed to be the major trigger of the adaptation of an organism to semistarvation. The aim of the current study is to define symptoms of AN that are potentially linked to low leptin levels. For this purpose, quantitative somatic and psychopathological variables were obtained in 61 inpatients with acute AN (study group 1) upon referral for inpatient treatment, and they were concomitantly blood sampled to allow determination of serum leptin levels. Correlations between these variables and logarithmic transformed (lg10) leptin levels were descriptively assessed. Apart from the well-known correlations between leptin levels and anthropometric measurements, the strongest correlation was observed between lg10 serum leptin levels and expert ratings of motor restlessness (r = -0.476; nominal P = 0.003) upon use of visual analog scales. We thus generated the hypothesis that physical activity levels in AN patients are related to serum leptin levels. This hypothesis was tested in an independent study group of 27 adolescent inpatients (study group 2) who were also assessed upon referral. Physical activity levels, which, in this study group, were assessed with the activity module of the expert rating form of the Structured Inventory for Anorexic and Bulimic Syndromes, were significantly correlated with lg10 leptin levels (r = -0.51; one-sided P = 0.006). A regression model based on the independent variables body mass index and lg10 leptin levels explained 37\% of the variance of physical activity (R(2) = 0.37; P = 0.003); only the lg10 leptin levels contributed significantly to the variance (P = 0.003). Our results suggest that, similar to semistarvation-induced hyperactivity in rats, hypoleptinemia in patients with AN may be one important factor underlying the excessive physical activity.}

METHODS:  Serum leptin, body mass index (BMI), \% body fat, and self- and expert-ratings of qualities of physical activity and restlessness were assessed in 26 inpatients with acute AN. Accelerometry was also performed. Regression analyses were used to predict activity and restlessness using BMI, \% body fat, and leptin levels as predictor variables. RESULTS:  Leptin levels significantly contributed to the prediction of all measures of activity and restlessness. CONCLUSIONS:  This is the first study linking hypoleptinemia in AN patients to subjective and objective measures of higher physical activity and motor and inner restlessness. Leptin may directly or indirectly (or both) influence behaviors and cognitions contributing to hyperactivity and motor restlessness.}

The primary aim of the present study was to quantify the incidence of overweight and obesity throughout childhood and adolescence in a large contemporary cohort of English children (the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, ALSPAC; children born 1991\textendash 1992). A secondary aim was to examine the persistence of overweight and obesity. Methods Longitudinal data on weight and height were collected annually from age 7\textendash 15years in the entire ALSPAC cohort (n=4283), and from 3 to 15years in a randomly selected subsample of the cohort (n=549; `Children in Focus' CiF). Incidence of overweight and obesity (BMI (Body mass index) at or above the 85th and 95th centiles relative to UK reference data) was calculated. Risk ratios (RR) for overweight and obesity at 15years based on weight status at 3, 7, and 11years were also calculated. Results In the entire cohort, four-year incidence of obesity was higher between ages 7 and 11years than between 11 and 15years (5.0\% vs 1.4\% respectively). In the CiF sub-sample, four-year incidence of obesity was also highest during mid-childhood (age 7\textendash 11years, 6.7\%), slightly lower during early childhood (3\textendash 7years, 5.1\%) and lowest during adolescence (11\textendash 15years 1.6\%). Overweight and obesity at all ages had a strong tendency to persist to age 15years as indicated by risk ratios (95\% CI (Confidence interval)) for overweight and obesity at 15years from overweight and obesity (relative to healthy weight status) at 3years (2.4, 1.8\textendash 3.1), 7years (4.6, 3.6\textendash 5.8), and 11years (9.3, 6.5\textendash 13.2). Conclusion Mid\textendash late childhood (around age 7\textendash 11years) may merit greater attention in future obesity prevention interventions.},

Features of msm include the ability to model transition rates and hidden Markov output models in terms of covariates, and the ability to model data with a variety of observation schemes, including censored states.},

  abstract = {Background and Objectives: A healthy diet during adolescence is important for growth and pubertal development. Assessing the diet of adolescents may be challenging as the behavioural factors and food habits which impact on what they eat may also affect how they report dietary intake. This study assesses factors associated with the misreporting of dietary intake.Methods: Adolescents (n = 4,844; average age 13.8 years) from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) completed a 3-day diet record. Misreporting was estimated using an individualised method, and adolescents were categorised by reporting status. Foods were categorised as core and noncore foods to evaluate diet quality. Body composition measurements were recorded at a research clinic. Information on dieting, weight concern, family socioeconomic status, and parental BMI were collected via questionnaires. Binary logistic regression was performed, in boys and girls separately, to investigate factors associated with underreporting of dietary intake.Results: Girls were much more likely than boys to be dissatisfied with their weight and to diet, but showed similar levels of underreporting (\textasciitilde 67\%). In adjusted regression analysis underreporters (UR) were more likely to be overweight or obese: OR in boys 2.8 (95\% CI 1.7\textendash 4.8) and in girls 2.2 (95\% CI 1.5\textendash 3.2). Dissatisfaction with weight and dieting were positively associated, and perception of being underweight negatively associated with underreporting in boys. Perception of being overweight, dieting, and exact age were positively associated with underreporting in girls. UR obtained a greater percentage of energy from protein and a smaller percentage of energy from fat; they reported greater intake of core foods and lower intakes of non-core foods than plausible reporters.Conclusion: A large proportion of adolescents underreported their dietary energy intake. This was associated with their body weight status and body image and had a differential effect on their estimated food and macronutrient intakes. Assessment of misreporting status is essential when collecting and interpreting dietary information from adolescents.},

  abstract = {Background: Graphical techniques can provide visually compelling insights into complex data patterns. In this paper we present a type of lasagne plot showing changes in categorical variables for participants measured at regular intervals over time and propose statistical models to estimate distributions of marginal and transitional probabilities. Methods: The plot uses stacked bars to show the distribution of categorical variables at each time interval, with different colours to depict different categories and changes in colours showing trajectories of participants over time. The models are based on nominal logistic regression which is appropriate for both ordinal and nominal categorical variables. To illustrate the plots and models we analyse data on smoking status, body mass index (BMI) and physical activity level from a longitudinal study on women's health. To estimate marginal distributions we fit survey wave as an explanatory variable whereas for transitional distributions we fit status of participants (e.g. smoking status) at previous surveys. Results: For the illustrative data the marginal models showed BMI increasing, physical activity decreasing and smoking decreasing linearly over time at the population level. The plots and transition models showed smoking status to be highly predictable for individuals whereas BMI was only moderately predictable and physical activity was virtually unpredictable. Most of the predictive power was obtained from participant status at the previous survey. Predicted probabilities from the models mostly agreed with observed probabilities indicating adequate goodness-of-fit. Conclusions: The proposed form of lasagne plot provides a simple visual aid to show transitions in categorical variables over time in longitudinal studies. The suggested models complement the plot and allow formal testing and estimation of marginal and transitional distributions. These simple tools can provide valuable insights into categorical data on individuals measured at regular intervals over time.},

The Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) monitors six categories of priority health-risk behaviors among youth and young adults: behaviors that contribute to unintentional and intentional injuries, tobacco use, alcohol and other drug use, sexual behaviors, unhealthy dietary behaviors, and physical inactivity. The YRBSS includes both a national school-based survey conducted by CDC and state and local school-based surveys conducted by state and local education agencies. This report summarizes results from the national survey, 35 state surveys, and 16 local surveys conducted among high school students from February through May 1995. In the United States, 72\% of all deaths among school-age youth and young adults result from four causes: motor vehicle crashes, other unintentional injuries, homicide, and suicide. Results from the 1995 YRBSS suggest that many high school students practice behaviors that may increase their likelihood of death from these four causes: 21.7\% had rarely or never used a safety belt, 38.8\% had ridden with a driver who had been drinking alcohol during the 30 days preceding the survey, 20.0\% had carried a weapon during the 30 days preceding the survey, 51.6\% had drunk alcohol during the 30 days preceding the survey, 25.3\% had used marijuana during the 30 days preceding the survey, and 8.7\% had attempted suicide during the 12 months preceding the survey. Substantial morbidity and social problems among school-age youth and young adults also result from unintended pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV infection. YRBSS results indicate that in 1995, 53.1\% of high school students had experienced sexual intercourse, 45.6\% of sexually active students had not used a condom at last sexual intercourse, and 2.0\% had ever injected an illegal drug. Among adults, 65\% of all deaths result from three causes: heart disease, cancer, and stroke. Most of the risk behaviors associated with these causes of death are initiated during adolescence. In 1995, 34.8\% of high school students had smoked cigarettes during the 30 days preceding the survey, 39.5\% had eaten more than two servings of foods typically high in fat content during the day preceding the survey, and only 25.4\% had attended physical education class daily. YRBSS data are being used nationwide by health and education officials to improve national, state, and local policies and programs designed to reduce risks associated with the leading causes of mortality and morbidity. YRBSS data also are being used to measure progress toward achieving 21 national health objectives and one of eight National Education Goals.},

Standard approaches address this issue by means of generalized estimating equations or generalized linear mixed models with logistic links. Using an empirical example and simulated data, we show (1) that cross-level product terms from these models can produce misleading results with respect to whether the within-person rate of change varies across levels of a dichotomous between-person factor; and (2) that subgroup differences in the rate of change should be assessed on an additive scale (using group differences in the effects of predictors on the probability of disease) rather than on a multiplicative scale (using group differences in the effects of predictors on the odds of disease). Because usual approaches do not provide a significance test for whether the rate of additive change varies across levels of a between-person factor, sample differences in the rate of additive change may be due to sampling error. We illustrate how standard software can be used to estimate and test whether additive changes vary across levels of a between-person factor.},

  abstract = {Objective Eating-related fear and anxiety are hallmark symptoms of eating disorders (EDs). However, it is still unclear which fears are most important (e.g., food, weight gain), which has practical implications, given treatments for eating-related fear necessitate modifications based on the specific fear driving ED pathology. For example, exposure treatments should be optimized based on specific fears that maintain pathology. The current study (N = 1,622 combined clinical ED and undergraduate sample) begins to answer questions on the precise nature of ED fears and how they operate with other ED symptoms. Method We used network analysis to create two models of ED fears and symptoms. The first model consisted of ED fears only (e.g., fears of food, fears of weight gain) to identify which fear is most central. The second model consisted of ED fears and ED symptoms to detect how ED fears operate with ED symptoms. Results We found fear of disliking how one's body feels due to weight gain, disliking eating in social situations, feeling tense around food, fear of judgment due to weight gain, and food anxiety were the most central ED fears. We also identified several bridge symptoms between ED fears and symptoms. Finally, we found that the most central ED fears predicted excessive exercise at two-month follow-up. Discussion These data support the idea that consequences (i.e., judgment) associated with fears of weight gain and interoceptive fears are the most central ED fears. These data have implications for the future development of precision interventions targeted to address ED-related fear.},

It is characterized by a craving for physical training, resulting in uncontrollable excessive exercise behavior with harmful consequences, such as injuries and impaired social relations. It has not been accepted as a mental disorder in either International Classification of Diseases or Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. The aim of this literature review was to critically examine the research on links (comorbidity), risks (negative consequences), and challenges faced (problems in a treatment context). This review found that compulsive exercise is associated with eating disorder pathology, perfectionism, neuroticism, narcissism, and obsessive compulsive traits. The most prominent negative consequences were injuries, social impairment, and depression, but more research is needed to uncover the potential dysfunction resulting from compulsive exercise. As the condition is not recognized as a psychiatric disorder, studies on treatment interventions are sparse. Problems with compliance have been reported; therefore, motivational interviewing has been proposed as a treatment approach, in combination with cognitive behavioral therapy. This review summarizes and discusses findings on links/comorbidity, risks/negative consequences, and treatment challenges. We suggest that future studies should pay attention to both prevention and counseling in sports settings, where compulsive exercise appears, as the condition may be associated with \-harmful consequences.},

Gender-stratified models were used to estimate prospective associations between childhood body dissatisfaction, body mass index (BMI), self-esteem, maternal eating disorder and family economic disadvantage on adolescent eating disorder behaviours and cognitions. RESULTS: Childhood body dissatisfaction strongly predicted eating disorder cognitions in girls, but only in interaction with BMI in boys. Higher self-esteem had a protective effect, particularly in boys. Maternal eating disorder predicted body dissatisfaction and weight/shape concern in adolescent girls and dieting in boys. CONCLUSIONS: Risk factors for eating disorder behaviours and cognitions vary according to gender. Prevention strategies should be gender-specific and target modifiable predictors in childhood and early adolescence.},

We investigated the association between binge eating and the individual and combined effect of 32 SNPs robustly associated with BMI in a population-based sample. We hypothesized that higher BMI and binge eating might share a common genetic etiology. METHODS: Binge eating was assessed in adolescents from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children at age 14 (n\,=\,5,958) and 16 years (n\,=\,4,948). We tested associations between 32 BMI-related SNPs and binge eating in crude and BMI-, age-, and gender-adjusted regression models. RESULTS: Crude analyses showed an association between binge eating and rs1558902 (FTO) that persisted after adjustment for BMI (OR\,=\,1.20, P\,=\,8 \texttimes{} 10(-3) ). A weighted allelic score consisting of all 32 BMI-related SNPs was associated with binge eating (P\,=\,8 \texttimes{} 10(-4) ); this association attenuated (P\,=\,0.08) when rs1558902 was removed from the weighted allelic score. CONCLUSIONS: BMI-related genes are associated with adolescent binge eating, in particular an FTO polymorphism. Although replication is needed, our findings have biological plausibility and are consistent with a postulated effect of FTO on appetite and food intake. Future studies should aim to understand the mechanisms underlying the relationship between FTO, binge eating, and obesity.},

We aimed to investigate the lifetime and 12-month prevalence of EDs and lifetime health service use and to identify childhood, parenting, and personality risk factors. METHODS:  This is a two-phase prevalence study, nested within an existing longitudinal community-based sample of women in mid-life. A total of 5658 women from the UK Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC; enrolled 20~years earlier) participated. ED diagnoses were obtained using validated structured interviews. Weighted analyses were carried out accounting for the two-phase methodology to obtain prevalence figures and to carry out risk factor regression analyses. RESULTS:  By mid-life, 15.3\% (95\% confidence intervals, 13.5-17.4\%) of women had met criteria for a lifetime ED. The 12-month prevalence of EDs was 3.6\%. Childhood sexual abuse was prospectively associated with all binge/purge type disorders and an external locus of control was associated with binge-eating disorder. Better maternal care was protective for bulimia nervosa. Childhood life events and interpersonal sensitivity were associated with all EDs. CONCLUSIONS:  By mid-life a significant proportion of women will experience an ED, and few women accessed healthcare. Active EDs are common in mid-life, both due to new onset and chronic disorders. Increased awareness of the full spectrum of EDs in this stage of life and adequate service provision is important. This is the first study to investigate childhood and personality risk factors for full threshold and sub-threshold EDs and to identify common predictors for full and sub-threshold EDs. Further research should clarify the role of preventable risk factors on both full and sub-threshold EDs.}

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE:  The current study informed the definition of "excessive exercise" by examining relations between exercise behavior, eating-disordered behavior, and quality of life (QOL) in a community sample of women. METHOD:  Self-report measures of frequency of exercise, obligatory exercise and motivation for exercise, and of eating disorder psychopathology and QOL, were completed by 3,472 women aged 18-42 years who engaged in regular exercise. RESULTS:  The extent to which exercise is intended to influence weight or shape and the degree to which guilt is experienced when exercise is postponed were the exercise variables most strongly associated with elevated levels of eating disorder psychopathology and reduced QOL. Subgroups of participants who reported exercising solely for weight and shape reasons (n = 322 [9.3\%]), intense guilt after postponement of exercise (n = 136 [3.9\%]), or both (n = 116 [3.3\%]), had markedly elevated levels of eating disorder psychopathology. There was no association between excessive exercise and reduced QOL after the effects of eating disorder psychopathology were statistically controlled. CONCLUSION:  The findings suggest that exercise is excessive when its postponement is accompanied by intense guilt or when it is undertaken solely to influence weight or shape. Operational definitions of excessive exercise might usefully include reference to these terms. The findings may also be of benefit in informing the content of prevention programs, which address dysfunctional exercise behavior. Excessive exercise is unlikely to be associated with impairment in psychosocial functioning in the absence of eating disorder psychopathology. It may, however, be a useful indicator of such psychopathology.},

This prompted a large-scale and systematic examination of the impact of CE in a representative ED sample. Methods: CE was examined in over 9000 female and male patients from a clinical ED database (covering out-patient, day and/or residential treatment) with respect to prevalence, ED diagnosis, ED symptoms, clinical features, patient characteristics, and outcome at 1-year follow-up. Relationships between changes in CE behavior and remission were also examined. Results: CE was a transdiagnostic symptom, present in nearly half of all patients (48\%). It was associated with greater overall ED pathology, particularly dietary restraint, and negative perfectionism. Initial CE did not impact remission rate, but patients continuing or starting CE during treatment had considerably lower remission rates compared to patients who never engaged in, or ceased with, CE. Results were comparable for females and males. Conclusions: At baseline, there were few differences between patients with and without CE, except a somewhat higher symptom load for patients with CE, and CE did not predict ED outcome. However, how CE developed during treatment to 1-year follow-up considerably impacted remission rates. We strongly recommend CE to be systematically assessed, addressed, and continuously evaluated in all ED patients seeking treatment.},

  abstract = {Behavior change is more effective and lasting when patients are autonomously motivated. To examine this idea, we identified 184 independent data sets from studies that utilized self-determination theory (SDT; Deci \& Ryan, 2000) in health care and health promotion contexts. A meta-analysis evaluated relations between the SDT-based constructs of practitioner support for patient autonomy and patients? experience of psychological need satisfaction, as well as relations between these SDT constructs and indices of mental and physical health. Results showed the expected relations among the SDT variables, as well as positive relations of psychological need satisfaction and autonomous motivation to beneficial health outcomes. Several variables (e.g., participants? age, study design) were tested as potential moderators when effect sizes were heterogeneous. Finally, we used path analyses of the meta-analyzed correlations to test the interrelations among the SDT variables. Results suggested that SDT is a viable conceptual framework to study antecedents and outcomes of motivation for health-related behaviors.}

  abstract = {Objective Though exercise behaviors are typically viewed as health-promoting, certain forms of exercise (i.e., excessive exercise, unhealthy muscle-building behaviors) are considered maladaptive and are associated with negative physical and psychological outcomes. Psychosocial factors may put people at greater risk for engaging in maladaptive exercise. Based on deviance regulation theory, weight bias was examined as a potential moderator of the association between exercise identity and both excessive exercise and muscle-building behaviors. Design The current study is a secondary analysis of a larger data set investigating associations between athletic identity, exercise behaviors, and disordered eating behaviors. Hypotheses were examined using moderation testing in multiple linear regression. Main outcome measures Participants (N~=~225, 50.2\% female) completed the Eating Pathology Symptoms Inventory as a measure of maladaptive exercise. Results Controlling for sex, age, athlete status, and body mass index, weight bias moderated the association between exercise identity and both excessive exercise and muscle-building behaviors. Among individuals with high exercise identity, higher weight bias was associated with increased maladaptive exercise behaviors. Conclusion Individuals with higher exercise identity and higher weight bias may be at greatest risk of engaging in maladaptive exercise. Preventive interventions for maladaptive exercise behaviors may consider targeting exercise identity and weight bias.},

While the impact of sociocultural influences on disordered eating has been identified in young people, sociocultural influences on compulsive exercise are yet to be systematically synthesized. This systematic review therefore aimed to synthesize literature examining sociocultural influences from peers, family and media on compulsive exercise, to explore the potential importance of such influences on the development and maintenance of compulsive exercise in young people. A systematic literature search was conducted following PRISMA guidelines in PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, MEDLINE, SPORTDiscus and Web of Science databases up to November 2021. Seven quantitative studies were included (five cross-sectional, two prospective). The review highlighted three key factors underpinning the relationship between sociocultural influences and compulsive exercise in young people: body-related messages from significant others, and unfavorable comparisons with, and pressure to conform to, body image ideals. The findings support the notion that compulsive exercise behaviors and attitudes can be socially determined. However, the limited research with young people necessitates further exploration of sociocultural influences on the development and onset of compulsive exercise in adolescence/young adulthood to develop robust conclusions. It is also crucial that research remains up to date with changing technological influences on exercise behaviors.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Maladaptive exercise relates to eating disorder (ED) pathology and impairment in clinical and non-clinical populations. At present, two different conceptualizations of maladaptive exercise are often studied in relation to ED pathology: compulsive exercise and exercise dependence. Compulsive exercise functions to avoid negative affect (e.g., guilt and anxiety) associated with not exercising, whereas exercise dependence is associated with tolerance to exercise benefits and avoidance of exercise withdrawal. At present, clinicians and researchers struggle to determine the most appropriate term for describing problematic exercise in individuals with ED pathology. This study aimed to directly compare these conceptualizations of maladaptive exercise in relation to severity of ED pathology. DESIGN: This study examined cross-sectional data. METHOD: Undergraduate participants (N =235, 78\% female) with elevated ED pathology completed the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q), Compulsive Exercise Test (CET), and Exercise Dependence Scale (EDS). Multiple linear regression analyses evaluated associations between EDE-Q and CET and EDS scores and dominance analysis determined which qualities of exercise were uniquely associated with EDE-Q scores. RESULTS: Results suggest that compulsive qualities of exercise, including exercise to control shape and weight and to avoid negative affect are more strongly associated with severity of ED pathology than qualities of exercise dependence. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians and researchers working with ED populations can benefit from prioritizing assessments that capture compulsive qualities of exercise. Additionally, these results suggest that interventions that effectively target other compulsive behaviors (e.g., exposure and response prevention) may be promising treatment options for problematic exercise in the context of EDs.},

Method Participants (N = 4,803) were children enrolled in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, a population-based, prospective study of women and their children. Regression methods tested associations between facets of neuropsychological functioning (attention, working memory, and inhibition) and eating disorder symptoms and diagnoses. Results Better scores on working memory tasks in childhood were associated with decreased risk of fasting but increased risk of excessive exercise during adolescence. Better inhibitory control was associated with decreased risk for disordered eating at age 14, and attentional difficulties were associated with increased risk for binge eating disorder during adolescence among boys but not girls. Conclusions Neuropsychological functioning may enhance risk for disordered eating behaviours in specific ways. Overall, effect sizes were small, and results did not support global associations between neuropsychological differences and ED risk in this sample.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Dysfunctional exercise is a common, debilitating symptom across eating disorders (ED). We examined the cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between experiences of exercise and ED behaviors and cognitions in an adolescent, population-based sample. METHODS: Adolescents (n = 4,054) self-reported whether they exercised to control shape and weight (exercise for weight loss [EWL]), and, if so, whether they exercised even when injured, and whether exercise interfered with life functioning (driven exercise) at age 14 years, allowing delineation of three exercise-based groups: no-EWL, EWL, and driven exercise. Participants also reported ED cognitions at age 14 years along with other ED behaviors (fasting, purging, binge eating) at ages 14 and 16 years. Sex-stratified regression approaches were employed to examine relationships between these exercise categories at age 14 and ED behaviors and cognitions at ages 14 and 16. RESULTS: Cross-sectionally, those in the driven exercise group, compared to the no-EWL group, consistently reported higher levels of ED cognitions and behaviors, with those in the EWL group also reporting higher levels of some ED cognitions and behaviors relative to the no-EWL group. Those in the EWL and driven exercise groups at age 14 also demonstrated a higher prospective likelihood of fasting (boys and girls) and purging (girls only) at age 16, relative to those in the no-EWL group at age 14. DISCUSSION: Results inform our understanding of EWL and driven exercise and the developmental timing of ED behaviors in adolescence and point toward the potential utility of targeted prevention for young people who report EWL.},

Accordingly, we developed two forms of a body rating scale (BRS) depicting adolescent females and administered these scales and the FRS to 315 female subjects. The subjects comprise three age groups, 11-year-olds, 17-year-olds, and their mothers, all participants in the epidemiologically based Minnesota Twin Family Study. Two independent observers also rated each subject. Results: Intercorrelations among raters and scales and with body mass index were generally high and indicate comparability between the BRS measures and the FRS. Discussion: The generally excellent psychometric properties of the new scales coupled with their face validity may make them a useful tool for body image research in children and adolescents. \textcopyright{} 1995 by John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

This trait has been studied extensively among animal models of activity anorexia nervosa (AN) and may hold particular interest as an endophenotype for AN. We explored features associated with excessive exercise across subtypes of eating disorders. METHOD:  Participants were female probands and affected female relatives from the multi-site international Price Foundation Genetic Studies with diagnoses of AN, bulimia nervosa (BN), and both AN and BN or eating disorder not otherwise specified (ED-NOS) (N=1,857). Excessive exercise was defined based on responses to the Structured Interview for Anorexic and Bulimic Disorders (SIAB). RESULTS:  Among the eating disorder diagnostic groups, excessive exercise was most common among the purging subtype of AN. Individuals who reported excessive exercise also reported lower minimum BMI, younger age at interview, higher scores on anxiety, perfectionism, and eating disorder symptom measures, more obsessions and compulsions, and greater persistence. CONCLUSION:  Excessive exercise may be associated particularly with the purging subtype of AN as well as with a constellation of anxious/obsessional temperament and personality characteristics among women with eating disorders.},

In Study 1, after controlling for key covariates, over-exercise was the only disordered eating variable that maintained a significant relationship with suicidal behavior. In Study 2, Time 1 over-exercise was the only disordered eating behavior that was associated with Time 2 ACS. In Study 3, pain insensitivity accounted for the relationship between over-exercise and ACS. In Study 4, ACS accounted for the relationship between over-exercise and suicidal behavior. Over-exercise appears to be associated with suicidal behavior, an association accounted for by pain insensitivity and the acquired capability for suicide; notably, this association was found across a series of four studies with different populations.}

This study was a retrospective analysis of 199 inpatient hospital records of female patients (age M=20.6, S.D.=7.03) in the following diagnostic categories: AN (n=115, 58\%), BN (n=38, 19\%), and EDNOS (n=46, 23\%). Patients were also grouped by a median split into low- and high-level exercise categories based on their total amount of weekly exercise. No significant relationship was found between diagnosis and exercise category (high and low) or diagnosis and exercise type (total, aerobic, and strength exercise). This is valuable because exercise specialist may be a worthwhile addition to treatment teams working with all eating disorder diagnostic groups. The high-level exercisers showed significantly greater scores on the EAT [F(2,1,110)=5.117, P{$<$}.05] and weight preoccupation [F(1,1010)=4.861, P{$<$}.05] than the low-level exercise groups. There were significant relationships between total exercise and EAT (r=.354, P{$<$}.01), drive for thinness (r=.262, P{$<$}.01), and body dissatisfaction (r=.312, P{$<$}.001). Total aerobic exercise was significantly related to EAT (r=.352, P{$<$}.001), drive for thinness (r=.272, P{$<$}.01), and body dissatisfaction (r=.268, P{$<$}.01). Finally, total strength exercise was related to body dissatisfaction (r=.249, P{$<$}.05). A significant difference was found among exercise group and length of hospitalization [F(1,155)=14.384, P{$<$}.000]. The high-level exercisers were in treatment for 3 weeks longer than their low-level exercisers. A forced stepwise multiple linear regression was calculated to predict the length of hospitalization. At Step 1, diagnosis and Body Mass Index (BMI) on admission explained 27\% of the variance in length of inpatient hospitalization [F(4,154)=18.08, P{$<$}.004, r(2)=.273]. When two exercise variables were included, aerobic activity explained an additional 5\% of variance, whereas strength activity explained an additional 0.3\% of the variance. Three-fourths of the predictors explained significant components of the total 32\% variance. The present study demonstrates that patients with greater total exercise and a greater total aerobic exercise show a significantly greater drive for thinness and require a longer length of hospitalization. This association was not present with total strength exercise levels. Effective clinical methods to modify total aerobic exercise levels need to be determined with inpatient populations.}

  abstract = {Tested an integrative model of bulimia that centers around dietary restraint and affect regulation pathways and incorporates perceived sociocultural pressure, body-mass, ideal-body internalization (IBI), and body dissatisfaction (BD). Using data from 257 female undergraduates (aged 17-52 yrs), structural equation modeling revealed that the model accounted for 71\% of the variance in bulimic symptomatology. Results provide consistent support for the dual pathway model of bulimia nervosa. Body mass was positively related to perceived pressure for a thin body and BD. Perceived pressure was related to BD both directly and indirectly through IBI. Also, significant paths were found from BD to bulimic symptomatology through both dietary restraint and negative affect, and dietary restraint predicted negative affect. Prevention programs focusing on IBI, BD, restraint, and negative affect in middle schools could reduce the prevalence of bulimia. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2009 APA, all rights reserved)},

Methods Participants were 380 consecutive referrals to a pediatric eating disorder program (90.8\% female; M age=14.9{$\pm$}2.2). Spearman's rho correlations examined the relation between DE frequency, and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Eating Disorders Examination (EDE) Global Severity scores. ANOVA compared those reporting only DE, only vomiting, or both DE and vomiting on the aforementioned measures. Results 51.3\% of participants (n=193) reported DE in the past 3months, with an average of 21.8 (SD=32.6) episodes. Frequency of DE was related to EDE global severity score (Spearman's rho=.46; p{$<$}.001) and BDI Total Score (Spearman's rho=.33; p{$<$}.001). Participants reporting both vomiting and DE had the highest EDE global severity and BDI total scores. Conclusions DE is associated with greater eating disorder and depressive symptomatology, especially when paired with vomiting. The findings highlight the importance of assessing for DE in youth presenting for eating disorder treatment.},

  abstract = {Obesity represents a major health problem in the United States and is associated with increased prevalence of cardiovascular (CV) disease risk factors. Physical activity (PA) and exercise training (ET) are associated with reduced CV risk, improved cardiometabolic risk factors, and facilitated weight loss through creating a negative energy balance. Clinicians need to counsel overweight and obese patients on how much PA/ET is needed to promote weight loss and weight loss maintenance. This will help establish realistic expectations and maximize improvements in CV risk factors. Although the minimum guidelines for aerobic PA (150\,min of moderate or 75\,min of vigorous physical activity per week) can improve CV health, these levels are generally inadequate for clinically significant weight loss or weight maintenance without caloric restriction. The purpose of this review is to evaluate the role of ET to promote clinically significant weight loss and promote weight maintenance. In particular, we will evaluate the likelihood of weight loss from ET programs composed of aerobic training only, resistance training only and programs that combine diet and ET. We will also explore the role of PA in promoting short-term and long-term weight maintenance.},

A national cross-sectional sample of 4-year colleges in the United States. Setting. Ninety-four 4-year colleges in the United States. Subjects. A total of 14,804 undergraduate students. Measures. Self-report vigorous physical activity, perceived stress (measured using the Cohen Perceived Stress Scale), mental health (measured using the SF-36), and socializing (assessed using self-report number of friends and hours spent socializing). Analysis. Logistic regression models accounting for clustering within schools were estimated to examine the association between vigorous physical activity, mental health, perceived stress, and socializing. Adjusted models included high school vigorous physical activity and sociodemographic characteristics. Results. Students who met vigorous physical activity recommendations were less likely to report poor mental health (adjusted odds ratio [OR]: .79; 95\% confidence interval [CI]: .69, .90) and perceived stress (adjusted OR: .75; 95\% CI: .67, .83) than students who did not meet recommendations. In addition, socializing partially mediated the relationship between vigorous physical activity, mental health, and perceived stress; however, race and sex did not moderate the relationship. Conclusion. Interventions aiming to improve mental well-being of college students should also consider promoting physical activity. At least some of the positive benefits of physical activity may arise from social interactions.}

  abstract = {The development of the Dutch Eating Behaviour Questionnaire (DEBQ) with scales for restrained, emotional, and external eating is described. Factor analyses have shown that all items on restrained and external eating each have high loadings on one factor, but items on emotional eating have two dimensions, one dealing with eating in response to diffuse emotions, and the other with eating in response to clearly labelled emotions. The pattern of corrected item-total correlation coefficients and of the factors was very similar for various subsamples, which indicates a high degree of stability of dimensions on the eating behavior scales. The norms and Cronbach's alpha coefficients of the scales and also the Pearson's correlation coefficients to assess interrelationships between scales indicate that the scales have a high internal consistency and factorial validity. However, their external validity has yet to be investigated.},

  abstract = {Background. Clinical, epidemiological, and genetic findings support an overlap between eating disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and anxiety symptoms. However, little research has examined the role of genetics in the expression of underlying phenotypes. We investigated whether the anorexia nervosa (AN), OCD, or AN/OCD transdiagnostic polygenic scores (PGS) predict eating disorder, OCD, and anxiety symptoms in a large developmental cohort in a sex-specific manner. Methods. Using summary statistics from Psychiatric Genomics Consortium AN and OCD genome-wide association studies, we conducted an AN/OCD transdiagnostic genome-wide association meta-analysis. We then calculated AN, OCD, and AN/OCD PGS in participants from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children to predict eating disorder, OCD, and anxiety symptoms, stratified by sex (combined N = 3212\textendash 5369 per phenotype). Results. The PGS prediction of eating disorder, OCD, and anxiety phenotypes differed between sexes, although effect sizes were small. AN and AN/OCD PGS played a more prominent role in predicting eating disorder and anxiety risk than OCD PGS, especially in girls. AN/OCD PGS provided a small boost over AN PGS in the prediction of some anxiety symptoms. All three PGS predicted higher compulsive exercise across different developmental timepoints [{$\beta$} = 0.03 (S.E. = 0.01) for AN and AN/OCD PGS at age 14; {$\beta$} = 0.05 (S.E. = 0.02) for OCD PGS at age 16] in girls. Conclusions. Compulsive exercise may have a transdiagnostic genetic etiology, and AN genetic risk may play a role in the presence of anxiety symptoms. Converging with prior twin literature, our results also suggest that some of the contribution of genetic risk may be sex-specific.},
