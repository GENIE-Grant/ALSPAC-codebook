## Body Discrepancy

### Key Variables

## Thin-ideal Internalization

Thin-ideal internalization at age 14 was assessed using the Ideal-Body Stereotype Scale-Revised (IBSS-R) [@sticeTestDualPathway1996] Girls and boys were both asked six questions, three of which were the same and three of which were gender-specific, assessing the perceived attractiveness of same-sex individuals based on physical characteristics (e.g. being 'lean', 'tall', 'petite'). Items are rated on a 5-point likert scale ranging from 'Strongly Disagree' (0) to 'Strongly Agree' (4) [@calzoSexualOrientationDisparities2018].

## Body Dissatisfaction

Body Dissatisfaction at age 14 was assessed via an 11-item scale adapted from the satisfaction and dissatisfaction with body parts scale [@sticeProspectiveTestDualpathway2001], which has been used in several previous studies involving the ALSPAC Cohort [@bornioliAdolescentBodyDissatisfaction2019; @bornioliBodyDissatisfactionPredicts2021; @schaumbergAnxietyDisorderSymptoms2019; @schaumbergProspectiveAssociationsChildhood2021]. Among the 11 items, one item differs between the sexes (satisfaction with 'breasts' is specified for girls and 'build' for boys). Two items address overall body satisfaction with weight and figure, and the remaining items evaluate satisfaction with specific body parts.

### Scoring

At age 14, responses are graded on a 5-point likert scale from "Extremely Satisfied" (1) to "Extremely Dissatisfied" (5). Body dissatisfaction was scored using the mean of all 11 items, with higher scores indicating greater body dissatisfaction.

### Key Variables

## Dieting

Dieting was assessed at ages 14, 16, and 18 years.

To assess dieting at age 14, participants were asked a set of two questions. Data from these questions has been used in multiple studies...(insert links). The two questions asked aim to learn the extent of dieting a respondent has taken part in. The first question aims to find the frequency of dieting and the second question asks about the length of diets in the past year.

### Scoring

### Key Variables

## Fear of Weight Gain

Fear of weight gain was assessed via a single item asking the degree to which participants have worried about gaining a little weight, using a likert response scale (0=not at all, 1=a little, 2=a lot, and 3=all the time).
