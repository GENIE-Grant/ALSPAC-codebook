<p>Restrictive Eating, External Eating, and Emotional Eating were assessed at child age 14 years by the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire (DEBQ)<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-vanstrienDutchEatingBehavior1986" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>vanstrienDutchEatingBehavior1986?</strong></a></sup></span>. Restrained eating addressed purposefully restricting intake regarding weight concerns. External eating addressed the likelihood of a participant eating due to external stimuli like the sight and smell of the food, regardless of the participant’s hunger level. Finally, emotional eating addressed how often the participant ate excessively when they experienced different emotional states.</p>
