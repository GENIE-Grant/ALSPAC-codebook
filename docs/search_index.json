"],["project-aims.html", "Chapter 2 Project Aims", " Chapter 2 Project Aims Maladaptive exercise is a common, debilitating symptom across eating disorders (ED). Up to 40% of individuals with bulimia nervosa and 80% of those with anorexia nervosa experience driven exercise. Driven exercise relates to high levels of ED symptoms and poor ED treatment outcomes, and has been purported to be an early ED symptom via retrospective reports. Among those with EDs, maladaptive exercise is associated with: increased risk for suicidal behavior; poor treatment outcome, disorder prognosis, and quality of life1,2 obsessive-compulsive traits and symptoms3–5; anxiety3,6; perfectionism3; body dissatisfaction7; reward dependence2; dietary restraint2,6; anhedonia8; and hypoleptinemia9,10. Further, maladaptive exercise has been hypothesized to be both compulsive11 and/or addictive12 in nature. Preliminary studies suggest a potential role of genetic factors influencing risk for this eating disorder feature. The most recently published genome-wide association study (GWAS) of AN from the Eating Disorders Workgroup of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium demonstrated a positive genetic correlation (rg = .17) with accelerometer-measured PA13, suggesting that some of the same factors that increase risk for AN are also operative in determining general PA levels. Further, preliminary findings examining polygenic prediction of eating disorder symptoms in the ALSPAC cohort supports the assertion that compulsive predisposition may impact the symptom of driven exercise, specifically. When examining obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and anorexia nervosa (AN) polygenic scores, along with a transdiagnostic OCD/AN polygenic score as predictors of a variety of eating disorder and anxiety-related symtpoms in early-to-mid adolescence, driven exercise was the only eating disorder symptom that was positively predicted (at at least one age and gender time point) by all three polygenic scores14 Overall, existing research points towards compulsivity and general propensity to exercise as potential risk factors for driven exercise. Further, driven exercise may be an early indicator of high eating disorder risk, as an additional investigation in the ALSPAC cohort found that both exercise for weight loss and driven exercise groups at age 14 were demonstrated higher levels of other ED behaviors (binge eating, fasting, purging) at age 1615. Enhanced understanding of driven exercise is critical as the eating disorder field grapples with designing appropriate interventions for those at risk for, in treatment for, or in remission from eating disorders. High levels of physical activity are frequently associated with positive mental and physical health outcomes16–18, and exercise (planned, structured, repetitive PA)19 is increasingly prescribed as a component of mental health treatment. Exercise also evidences some therapeutic benefit in ED treatment, including preventing loss of bone density, enhancing cognitive functioning, self-regulation, social engagement, and mood regulation, and reducing discomfort during future eating episodes20–22. As a result of the complex relationship between exercise and EDs, more sophisticated research on this phenotype is needed. At present, we know relatively little about the etiology of DEx, including potential genetic influences on the symptom, its relationship to premorbid activity levels, or how to manage this symptom. In addition, we do not understand factors that contribute to the substantial variability in physical activity among those with eating disorders, and why only a portion of individuals present with driven exercise. Given the critical need to improve treatment for individuals with eating disorders, and even more-so for those who engage in driven exercise, improving our understanding of risk for this symptom is paramount. In the current line of research, we are extend a longitudinal investigation of exercise for weight loss and driven exercise across a larger developmental window (ages 14-24) in the ALSPAC Cohort. Aims of the research include: Aim Goal Hypothesis 1 Identify and characterize the physical activity trajectories from late childhood through emerging adulthood in ALSPAC and capture associations with driven exercise and eating disorder risk. High levels of activity in childhood and early adolescence will associate with both DEx and ED risk in adolescence 2 Determine the strength of DEx as a predictor of eating disorder pathology DEx will present early in the course of EDs, with peak age of onset in early-to-mid adolescence, and will predict ED onset and maintenance beyond other risk factors (e.g. dieting, thin-deal internalization) 3 Demonstrate the influence of genomic risk factors on DEx ‘Anthropometric/Activity’ and ‘Compulsivity’ genomic risk factors will be identified and will predict DEx References "],["the-alspac-cohort.html", "Chapter 3 The ALSPAC Cohort", " Chapter 3 The ALSPAC Cohort The ALSPAC Cohort23,24 was established to understand how genetic and environmental characteristics influence health and development in parents and children. Ethical approval for this study was granted by the ALSPAC Law and Ethics Committee and Local Ethics Committees. All pregnant women living in the geographical area of Avon, United Kingdom, who were expected to deliver between April 1, 1991 and December 31, 1992, were invited to participate in the study. Children from 14,541 pregnancies were enrolled; 13,988 children were alive at 1 year. An additional 913 children were enrolled during subsequent phases of enrollment, with a total sample size alive at 1 year of 14,901. All women gave informed and written consent. Among twin pairs, one twin per pair was randomly excluded from the current study. ## instert figure with N&#39;s across relevant time points and ages used for the current study. #Physical Activity at 9, 11, 13, and 15 #BMI across ages #Eating Disorder Behaviors at 14,16,18, and 24 References "],["scoring.html", "Chapter 4 Scoring", " Chapter 4 Scoring Data cleaning and scoring procedures were completed primarily with the scorekeeper R package. The scorekeeper package is available via github installation see package documentation , and also contains an accompanying vignette and youtube playlist for those getting started with the package. Data is scored using scoresheets (.csv files) and an accompanying R script. All scoring described in this data dictionary can be fully replicated by downloading scoresheets from the scoresheet repository associated with this project and running the accompanying R script to score data. If you are attempting to replicate our scoring procedures, please ensure the following: You are importing your raw data into R using the haven package, such that raw data types are ‘haven labelled’. Your dataset contains all of the raw variables necessary to complete scoring calculations. If you do not have all raw variables in your dataset, you will need to adjust scoresheets such that raw variables that you do not have are omitted from scoring procedures.

Questions were adapted to enquire about the previous year26, and have been validated in a sample of adolescents in the Growing Up Today Study27. Binge Eating Behavior in the ALSPAC data has previously been scored and examined in several papers14,26,28–30. At ages 14, 16, and 18, Binge eating was assessed using a two-part question. Participants were first asked about the frequency during the past year of eating a very large amount of food. Those who answered yes were asked a follow-up question that asked whether they felt out of control during these episodes, i.e., whether they could not stop eating even if they wanted to stop, along with five other questions regarding characterization of binge eating episodes (e.g. how often they felt guilty after a binge, how often they ate fast or faster than normal during a binge) 6.1.2 Scoresheet The binge eating scoresheet can be found here To clean the data, the scoresheet: selects only the variables that are relevant for the current measure appropriately accounts for the skip patterns in the data (recoding to ‘no’ follow-up questions for individuals who reported no binge eating) recodes the variables to sensible frequencies (e.g. changing a ‘no’ answer to be represented as ‘0’ with increasing frequency incrementing from zero) and computes dichotomized versions of the presence vs. absence of symptoms for use in symptom counts. Creates a symptom sum score, which gives a count of the number of binge eating symptoms (0-6) that are present for each individual at ages 14, 16, and 18 years. Creates two additional variables based on the sum score. The first variable computes a variable that notes binge eating is present (‘1’) if an individual reports binge eating at least once per month with more than two additional symptoms. The second splits cases into ‘absent’, ‘mild’, and ‘severe’ based on the number of symptoms reported. The tibble is then filtered to exclude cases with all missing data. 6.1.3 Key Variables 6.2 Compensatory Behaviors 6.2.1 Background 6.2.2 Scoring 6.2.3 Key Variables 6.3 Driven Exercise 6.3.1 Background 6.3.2 Scoring 6.3.3 Key Variables References "],["anthropometric-variables.html", "Chapter 7 Anthropometric Variables 7.1 Body Mass Index (BMI) 7.2 DEXA Scans", " Chapter 7 Anthropometric Variables Anthropometric variables were collected and/or reported at several time points during development.
