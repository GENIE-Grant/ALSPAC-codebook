"],["project-aims.html", "Chapter 2 Project Aims", " Chapter 2 Project Aims Maladaptive exercise is a common, debilitating symptom across eating disorders (ED). Up to 40% of individuals with bulimia nervosa and 80% of those with anorexia nervosa experience driven exercise. Driven exercise relates to high levels of ED symptoms and poor ED treatment outcomes, and has been purported to be an early ED symptom via retrospective reports. Among those with EDs, maladaptive exercise is associated with: increased risk for suicidal behavior; poor treatment outcome, disorder prognosis, and quality of life1,2 obsessive-compulsive traits and symptoms3–5; anxiety3,6; perfectionism3; body dissatisfaction7; reward dependence2; dietary restraint2,6; anhedonia8; and hypoleptinemia9,10. Further, maladaptive exercise has been hypothesized to be both compulsive11 and/or addictive12 in nature. Preliminary studies suggest a potential role of genetic factors influencing risk for this eating disorder feature. The most recently published genome-wide association study (GWAS) of AN from the Eating Disorders Workgroup of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium demonstrated a positive genetic correlation (rg = .17) with accelerometer-measured PA13, suggesting that some of the same factors that increase risk for AN are also operative in determining general PA levels. Further, preliminary findings examining polygenic prediction of eating disorder symptoms in the ALSPAC cohort supports the assertion that compulsive predisposition may impact the symptom of driven exercise, specifically. When examining obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and anorexia nervosa (AN) polygenic scores, along with a transdiagnostic OCD/AN polygenic score as predictors of a variety of eating disorder and anxiety-related symtpoms in early-to-mid adolescence, driven exercise was the only eating disorder symptom that was positively predicted (at at least one age and gender time point) by all three polygenic scores14 Overall, existing research points towards compulsivity and general propensity to exercise as potential risk factors for driven exercise. Further, driven exercise may be an early indicator of high eating disorder risk, as an additional investigation in the ALSPAC cohort found that both exercise for weight loss and driven exercise groups at age 14 were demonstrated higher levels of other ED behaviors (binge eating, fasting, purging) at age 1615. Enhanced understanding of driven exercise is critical as the eating disorder field grapples with designing appropriate interventions for those at risk for, in treatment for, or in remission from eating disorders. High levels of physical activity are frequently associated with positive mental and physical health outcomes16–18, and exercise (planned, structured, repetitive PA)19 is increasingly prescribed as a component of mental health treatment. Exercise also evidences some therapeutic benefit in ED treatment, including preventing loss of bone density, enhancing cognitive functioning, self-regulation, social engagement, and mood regulation, and reducing discomfort during future eating episodes20–22. As a result of the complex relationship between exercise and EDs, more sophisticated research on this phenotype is needed. At present, we know relatively little about the etiology of DEx, including potential genetic influences on the symptom, its relationship to premorbid activity levels, or how to manage this symptom. In addition, we do not understand factors that contribute to the substantial variability in physical activity among those with eating disorders, and why only a portion of individuals present with driven exercise. Given the critical need to improve treatment for individuals with eating disorders, and even more-so for those who engage in driven exercise, improving our understanding of risk for this symptom is paramount. In the current line of research, we are extend a longitudinal investigation of exercise for weight loss and driven exercise across a larger developmental window (ages 14-24) in the ALSPAC Cohort. Aims of the research include: Aim Goal Hypothesis 1 Identify and characterize the physical activity trajectories from late childhood through emerging adulthood in ALSPAC and capture associations with driven exercise and eating disorder risk. High levels of activity in childhood and early adolescence will associate with both DEx and ED risk in adolescence 2 Determine the strength of DEx as a predictor of eating disorder pathology DEx will present early in the course of EDs, with peak age of onset in early-to-mid adolescence, and will predict ED onset and maintenance beyond other risk factors (e.g. dieting, thin-deal internalization) 3 Demonstrate the influence of genomic risk factors on DEx ‘Anthropometric/Activity’ and ‘Compulsivity’ genomic risk factors will be identified and will predict DEx References "],["the-alspac-cohort.html", "Chapter 3 The ALSPAC Cohort", " Chapter 3 The ALSPAC Cohort The ALSPAC Cohort23,24 was established to understand how genetic and environmental characteristics influence health and development in parents and children.

The FRS presents participants with either 5 female or male figures (dependent on the sex of the participant) of different weights and heights and asks which figure the participant most resembles and which figure the participant desires to resemble. 5.1.1 Scoring Responses for figures varying in weight were scored as ‘very thin’, ‘thin’, ‘average’, ‘fat’, or ‘very fat’ while figures varying in height were scored as ‘very short’, ‘short’, ‘average’, ‘tall’, or ‘very tall’. A body discrepancy score is generated by subtracting the ideal body weight/height chosen from the current perceived body weight/height (higher scores indicate higher body dissatisfaction). 5.1.2 Key Variables body_percept_10 How respondent perceives body based on the five figures body_desire_10 How respondent desires to look based on the five figures 5.2 Thin-ideal Internalization Thin-ideal internalization at age 14 was assessed using the Ideal-Body Stereotype Scale-Revised (IBSS-R)sticeTestDualPathway1996?

Restrained eating addressed purposefully restricting intake regarding weight concerns. External eating addressed the likelihood of a participant eating due to external stimuli like the sight and smell of the food, regardless of the participant’s hunger level. Finally, emotional eating addressed how often the participant ate excessively when they experienced different emotional states. 5.3.4 Scoring &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD Depending on the phrasing of the items, responses were either asked on a scale of ‘Yes, usually want to eat more’ (1), ‘Sometimes want to eat more’ (2), or ‘No, not at all’ (3) or on a scale of ‘Never’ (1), ‘Occasionally’ (2), ‘Sometimes’ (3), or ‘Frequently’ (4). ======= Depending on the phrasing of the items, responses were either asked on a scale of ‘Yes, usually want to eat more’ (1), ‘Sometimes want to eat more’ (2), or ‘No, not at all’ (3) or on a scale of ‘Never’ (1), ‘Occasionally’ (2), ‘Sometimes’ (3), or ‘Frequently’ (4).

To assess dieting, participants were asked a set of questions regarding dieting strategies to lose or keep from gaining weight and actual weight loss in the past year. While these items are original to the ALSPAC study, thesy have been used in multiple studies to assess the overall level of dieting in adolescents25 jonesMisreportingEnergyIntake2021?. The question consists of multiple parts with the aim to learn the extent of dieting a respondent has taken part in. The first part of the question aims to find the type of diet(s) and length of time the participant has engaged in said diet(s) and the second part asks about weight lost during the diet and possible weight gain succeeding the diet. 6.1.1 Scoring When asked if the participant has gone on a diet in the past year, responses range from ‘Always on a diet’ (1) to ‘never’ (5). If respondent selects any answer other than ‘never’, they are then prompted to respond how long they engaged in the diet(s) (‘less than a week’, ‘1-3 weeks’, ‘1-3 months’, or ‘3 or 4 months’) and the type of diet(s) they used. The participant also answers how many pounds they lost while on to the diet(s) and, if they did lose weight, if they gained any of the weight back after the diet (‘No, did not regain any of the weight’, ‘Gained back a little of the weight”, ’Gained back most of the weight’, ‘Gained back all of the weight’, or ‘put on more than I lost’). 6.1.2 Key Variables diet_freq_14 frequency respondent went on a diet to lose weight or keep from gaining weight during the past year at age 14 diet_length_14 Time respondent was on a diet at age 14 diet_freq_16 frequency respondent went on a diet to lose weight or keep from gaining weight during the past year at age 16 diet_length_16 Time respondent was on a diet at age 16 diet_lost_16 Weight the respondent lost due to diet at age 16 diet_regain_16 Weight the respondent gained back, if applicable, after diet at age 16 6.2 Fear of Weight Gain Fear of weight gain was assessed at Wave 14 and Wave 24 via a single item asking the degree to which participants have worried about gaining a little weight (as little as one kilo). 6.2.1 Scoring Participants scored their fear of weight gain on a 4-point Likert response scale: ‘Not at all’ (0), ‘A little’ (1), ‘A lot’ (2), and ‘All the time’ (3). 6.2.2 Key Variables fear_wtgain_14 Respondent’s fear of weight gain at age 14 6.3 Weight Intentions, Perception, and Valuation Weight intentions, perception, and valuation were all asked with the pretense that there is no correct answer and participants should answer how they think. Weight intentions and perception were assessed at ages 14 and 18 while weight valuation was only asked at age 18. At both Wave 14 and Wave 18, Weight intentions was assessed in 1 item that asked participants about what they intend to do with their weight. Weight perception asks participants to describe their current weight. Weight valuation, which was asked at age 18, was also a 1-item question that asked how weight has made a difference in how the participant sees oneself. 6.3.1 Scoring Weight intentions was scored using 4 response options: ‘I am not trying to do anything about my weight’, ‘Stay the same’, ‘Gain weight’, or ‘Lose weight’. Weight perception gave a range of 5 responses from ‘Very underweight’ to ‘Very overweight’. Weight valuation was scored on a 5-point Likert scale from ‘Not at all’ (1) to ‘A lot’ (5). 6.3.2 Key Variables wt_intent_18 Respondent’s intent with weight at age 18 wt_perception_18 Description of respondent’s current weight at age 18 wt_valuation_18 Degree to which respondent’s weight has made difference to how feel about self in past year at age 18 6.4 Feeling Fat Individuals were asked at age 24 how often they ‘felt fat’ in the past year. 6.4.1 Scoring Response options were ‘Never’ (0), ‘A little’ (1), ‘Sometimes’ (2), ‘A lot’ (3), and ‘Always’ (4). 6.4.2 Key Variables feel_fat_24 How much respondent has ‘felt fat’ in the past year at age 24 References "],["eating-disorder-behaviors.html", "Chapter 7 Eating Disorder Behaviors 7.1 Purging 7.2 Dieting/Restriction 7.3 Maladpative Exercise 7.4 Fasting", " Chapter 7 Eating Disorder Behaviors Eating Disorder Behaviors Were Assessed at Ages 14, 16, 18, and 24. Scoring for eating disorder behaviors is completed with a single scoresheet, ed_behaviors_scoresheet.xlsx, resulting in a data frame which contains all eating disorder behavior variables, titled ed_behaviors in the cleaned dataset. 7.0.1 Binge Eating Binge eating behavior was evaluated using questions derived from the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance Scale26 at ages 14, 16, 18, and 24. Questions were adapted to inquire about the previous year25 and have been validated in a sample of adolescents in the Growing Up Today Study27. Binge Eating Behavior in the ALSPAC data has previously been scored and examined in several papers14,25,28–30. At ages 14, 16, and 18, Binge eating was assessed using a two-part question. Participants were first asked about the frequency during the past year of eating a very large amount of food. Those who answered yes were asked a follow-up question that asked whether they felt out of control during these episodes, i.e., whether they could not stop eating even if they wanted to stop, along with five other questions regarding characterization of binge eating episodes (e.g. how often they felt guilty after a binge, how often they ate fast or faster than normal during a binge). Participants who reported any binge eating were then asked to rate five binge eating symptoms (eating faster than normal, stomach hurting or feeling sick, eating large amounts of food, hiding amount eating when on a binge, and feeling guilty after a binge) as to whether they happened never, sometimes, or usually. At age 24, participants were asked how often they went on eating binges in the past year (never, &lt;1x/mo, 1-3x/mo, 1x/wk, or &gt;1x/wk), and, if so, whether a period of frequent binge eating lasted at least three months. 7.0.2 Scoring Scoring for questions related to binge eating recodes variables to sensible frequencies (e.g. changing a ‘no’ answer to be represented as ‘0’ with increasing frequency incrementing from zero) and computes dichotomized versions of the presence vs. absence of symptoms for use in symptom counts. Symptom sum scores, which gives a count of the number of binge eating symptoms (0-5) that are present for each individual ‘sometimes’ or ‘usually’ at ages 14, 16, and 18 years, are then computed. Based on the sum score, two additional variables based on the sum score. The first variable computes a variable that notes binge eating is present (‘1’) if an individual reports binge eating at least once per month with more than two additional symptoms (Subclinical BED criteria met) at ages 14, 16, and 18, and binge eating at least once per month at age 24. The second variable computes a variable that notes full threshold Binge Eating Disorder criteria are met (binge eating weekly plus three or more additional psychological symptoms at 14-18; weekly binge eating lasting three months per more at age 24). 7.0.3 Key Variables ‘x’ represents age of assessment for the following variables: binge_freq_o.x - frequency of binge eating at each timepoint binge_sx_sum.x - Number of binge eating psychological symptoms binge_sub_criteria_met.x - dichotomous variable indicating whether subthreshold binge eating disorder symptoms are met binge_criteria_met.x - dichotomous variable indicating whether full threshold binge eating disorder symptoms are met 7.1 Purging 7.1.1 Background Purging was evaluated using questions derived from the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance Scale26 at age 14, 16 and 18. Participants were asked about how often they had made themselves sick or used laxatives in order to control weight or shape in the past year. 7.1.2 Scoring 7.1.3 Key Variables 7.2 Dieting/Restriction 7.2.1 Background Dieting and restriction was evaluated using questions derived from the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance Scale26 at age 14, 16 and 18. Participants were asked if they had gone on a diet to lose weight or to keep from gaining weight within the past year. 7.2.2 Scoring 7.2.3 Key Variables 7.3 Maladpative Exercise Questions related to maladaptive exercise were self-reported at ages 14, 16, 18, and 24 years. Questions were adapted from the Youth Risk Behavior Survelliance SystemkannYouthRiskBehavior1995?. 7.3.0.1 Exercise for Weight Loss At ages 14, 16, and 18 years, participants were asked if they exercised to lose weight or avoid gaining weight, with response options of: No(0), Yes-Sometimes(1), and Yes-Frequently(2). At age 24, participants were asked the frequency with which they exercised to lose weight or avoid gaining weight, with response options of: Never, &lt;1x/mo, 1-3x/mo, 1-4x/wk, and 5 or more times per week. For the purposes of analysis, responses at age 24 were harmonized with age 14, 16, and 18. Responses of Never were binned as “No” (0); 1x/mo - &lt;1x/week were binned as ‘Yes - Sometimes’(1), and 1x/wk or more as ‘Yes - Frequently’(2). Once a week or more was chosen as the threshold for ‘frequent’ exercise for weight loss at age 24 to align with DSM-V diagnostic frequency thresholds for other eating disorder behaviors, such as binge eating and purgingamericanpsychiatricassociationDiagnosticStatisticalManual2013?. The primary derived outcome variable of analysis for exercise for weight loss is an ordinal variable, defined as 0 = No, 1 = Sometimes, and 2 = Frequently. 7.3.0.2 Maladaptive Exercise Indicators Issues that are associated with exercise were also reported at ages 14,16, 18, and 24 years. At all assessment points, participants reported whether exercise interferes with work/school (14,16,18), or their daily routine (24). At ages 14 and 24, participants also reported whether they exercised to lose weight even when sick or injured. At ages 16 and 18 years, participants reported whether they felt guilty about missing an exercise session – see Table 7.1 . Responses options for exercise issues were ‘No’, ‘yes - Sometimes’, or ‘Yes - Frequently’. 7.3.1 Key Variables x &lt;- tibble(Age = c(14,16,18,24), Interferes = c(&#39;x&#39;,&#39;x&#39;,&#39;x&#39;,&#39;x&#39;), Sick_Injured = c(&#39;x&#39;,&#39; &#39;,&#39; &#39;, &#39;x&#39;), Guilt = c(&#39;&#39; ,&#39;x&#39;,&#39;x&#39;, &#39;&#39;)) kableExtra::kbl(x, caption = &#39;Exercise Issues Assessed at Each Age&#39;) %&gt;% kableExtra::kable_styling() Table 7.1: Exercise Issues Assessed at Each Age Age Interferes Sick_Injured Guilt 14 x x 16 x x 18 x x 24 x x Exercise issues are deemed to be ‘present’ at each time point if an individual endorses: (1) exercise interfering with work/school sometimes or more OR frequent guilt when missing an exercise session at ages 16 and 18 years and (2) exercise interfering with work/school/daily routine sometimes or more OR exercising even when sick/injured sometimes or more at ages 14 and 24 years. The presence of maladaptive exercise in this study was defined as exercising for weight loss sometimes or frequently and at least one exercise issue defined as present at each time point. Frequency of exercise for weight loss as sometimes or more was chosen for this definition as (1) existing literature suggests that frequency of exercise may be less important than cognitive features in defining exercise risk in the context of eating disordersadkinsDoesExcessiveCompulsive2005?,mondUpdateDefinitionExcessive2006? and (2) the nature of the epidemiological sample and the concomitant goals of this paper are such that we are interested in identifying early risk indicators, which may be best captured via a broad (vs. narrow) definition of maladaptive exercise. The primary variable to define maladaptive exercise was derived as described, resulting in a dichotomous outcome (0 = Absent, 1 = Present). 7.3.1.1 Exercise Groups Exercise groups over time are defined for descriptive analyses and transition states, replicating groups defined in15. Those who report no exercise for weight loss at each time point are placed in a ‘No Exercise for Weight Loss’ group, those who report exercise for weight loss at least sometimes, but do not meet criteria for maladaptive exercise are placed in an ‘Exercise for Weight Loss’ group, and those meeting maladaptive exercise criteria are placed in the ‘Maladaptive Exercise’ group. 7.4 Fasting 7.4.1 Background Fasting was evaluated using questions derived from the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance Scale26 at age 14, 16, 18, and 24. Participants reported their frequency of fasting to lose or avoid gaining weight. Participants that endorsed any fasting at age 14, 16, 18, or 24 were coded as coded as ‘yes’ to fasting for weight loss. 7.4.2 Scoring A response of yes ‘1’ to any instances of fasting at any age resulted in follow up questions to determine the frequency of fasting. 7.4.3 Key Variables fasting_any.167- fasting at age 14 - any reported fasting_monthly.167- fasting at age 14 - at least once per month fasting_monthly.weekly- fasting at age 14 - at least once per week ?? 7.4.4 Eating Disorder Diagnoses Eating disorder diagnoses (AN, BN,BED, BN-Spectrum [Purging disorder and subclinical BN], BED-spectrum [subclinical BED], and Restrictive spectrum [ED cognitions and restrictive ED behaviors in the absence of regular binge eating, purging, or low weight]) were derived at each age (14, 16, 18, and 24) using best available measures and following steps outlined inmicaliAdolescentEatingDisorders2015?, with minor changes (cognitive measures added to criteria as available; subclinical and OSFED categories collapsed to reflect BN, BED, and Restrictive Spectrum ED pathology). Scoring algorithms reflect DSM-5 criteria aligned as well as possible with available data that can be harmonized across assessment pointsamericanpsychiatricassociationDiagnosticStatisticalManual2013?. While the majority of cognitive and and behavioral ED features are self-reported, parent-report of restrictive eating was included as an indicator at ages 14 and 16 years as adolescents tend to under-report AN symptomshouseDiagnosingEatingDisorders2008?.

Criteria thus not required for diagnosis at relevant timepoint. Wt = Weight. AN criteria ‘Fear of Gaining Weight’ and ‘Disturbance in body weight/shape, self-worth influenced by weight and shape, or persistent lack of recognition of seriousness of low body weight’ combined as a single indicator due to inconsistent measurement in fear of weight gain and potential for lack of insight amongst youth. At each timepoint, diagnosis was given hierarchically from top to bottom of the table (e.g. if symptoms meeting criteria for AN and BN are both endorsed, AN is the given diagnosis).

A ‘best available’ BMI (and accompanying BMIz score) within the past year at target ages 11.0, 14.0, 16.0, and 18.0 is also calculated. This ‘best available’ BMI data uses clinic data when available and self/parent-report data if clinic data is not available. This approach is used to maximize accuracy and coverage of data when BMI at a specified age is to be used for eating disorder diagnosis and/or employed as an analytic predictor. 8.3 Key Variables BMIz scores prior to age 18 are noted as: BMIz_clinic.X Objective obtained BMI at clinic where X = age in years at time when assessment was targeted to be completed, rounded to one tenth.
