# Data Dictionary for ALSPAC data: R01MH134039

This book contains information on data management and scoring for ALSPAC eating disorder and associated variables. This data dictionary is specifically designed for the project - R01MH134039 - 'Integrating developmental and genomic approaches to identify early trajectories of eating and internalizing disorder symptoms'

Data in this dictionary represents only variables obtained and cleaned for this project -- the complete set of raw variables available from the ALSPAC cohort can be found in the larger ALSPAC [data dictionary](http://www.bris.ac.uk/alspac/researchers/data-access/data-dictionary/).
