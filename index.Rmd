# Data Dictionary for ALSPAC data: K01MH123914

This book contains information on data management and scoring for ALSPAC eating disorder and associated variables, maintained by the [EMBARK Lab](https://embark.psychiatry.wisc.edu). This data dictionary is specifically designed for the project - K01MH123914 - "Driven Exercise in Eating Disorders: A Combined Genetic and Longitudinal Epidemiological Investigation. 

Data in this dictionary represents only variables obtained and cleaned for this project -- the complete set of raw variables available from the ALSPAC cohort can be found in the larger ALSPAC [data dictionary](http://www.bris.ac.uk/alspac/researchers/data-access/data-dictionary/).
