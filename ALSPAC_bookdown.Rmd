# Project Aims

Maladaptive exercise is a common, debilitating symptom across eating disorders (ED). Up to 40% of individuals with bulimia nervosa and 80% of those with anorexia nervosa experience driven exercise. Driven exercise relates to high levels of ED symptoms and poor ED treatment outcomes, and has been purported to be an early ED symptom via retrospective reports. Among those with EDs, maladaptive exercise is associated with: increased risk for suicidal behavior; poor treatment outcome, disorder prognosis, and quality of life[@adamsExerciseDependenceReview1998; @dallegraveCompulsiveExerciseControl2008] obsessive-compulsive traits and symptoms[@shroffFeaturesAssociatedExcessive2006; @davisPrevalenceHighlevelExercise1997; @davisAnorexiaNervosaExcessive2006]; anxiety[@shroffFeaturesAssociatedExcessive2006; @holtkampContributionAnxietyFood2004]; perfectionism[@shroffFeaturesAssociatedExcessive2006]; body dissatisfaction [@brewertonComparisonEatingDisorder1995]; reward dependence[@dallegraveCompulsiveExerciseControl2008]; dietary restraint[@dallegraveCompulsiveExerciseControl2008; @holtkampContributionAnxietyFood2004]; anhedonia [@davisSensitivityRewardingEffects2002]; and hypoleptinemia [@holtkampElevatedPhysicalActivity2003; @holtkampPhysicalActivityRestlessness2006]. Further, maladaptive exercise has been hypothesized to be both compulsive[@meyerCompulsiveExerciseEating2011] and/or addictive [@cookExerciseAddictionCompulsive2014] in nature. 

Preliminary studies suggest a potential role of genetic factors influencing risk for this eating disorder feature. The most recently published genome-wide association study (GWAS) of AN from the Eating Disorders Workgroup of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium demonstrated a positive genetic correlation (*r~g~* = .17) with accelerometer-measured PA [@anorexianervosageneticsinitiativeGenomewideAssociationStudy2019], suggesting that some of the same factors that increase risk for AN are also operative in determining general PA levels. Further, preliminary findings examining polygenic prediction of eating disorder symptoms in the ALSPAC cohort supports the assertion that compulsive predisposition may impact the symptom of driven exercise, specifically. When examining obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and anorexia nervosa (AN) polygenic scores, along with a transdiagnostic OCD/AN polygenic score as predictors of a variety of eating disorder and anxiety-related symtpoms in early-to-mid adolescence, driven exercise was the only eating disorder symptom that was positively predicted (at at least one age and gender time point) by all three polygenic scores[@yilmazPredictingEatingDisorder2022]

Overall, existing research points towards compulsivity and general propensity to exercise as potential risk factors for driven exercise. Further, driven exercise may be an early indicator of high eating disorder risk, as an additional investigation in the ALSPAC cohort found that both exercise for weight loss and driven exercise groups at age 14 were demonstrated higher levels of other ED behaviors (binge eating, fasting, purging) at age 16[@schaumbergProspectiveAssociationsDriven2022].
  

Enhanced understanding of driven exercise is critical as the eating disorder field grapples with designing appropriate interventions for those at risk for, in treatment for, or in remission from eating disorders. High levels of physical activity are frequently associated with positive mental and physical health outcomes[@chekroudAssociationPhysicalExercise2018; @vankimVigorousPhysicalActivity2013; @deslandesExerciseMentalHealth2009], and exercise (planned, structured, repetitive PA)[@caspersenPhysicalActivityExercise1985] is increasingly prescribed as a component of mental health treatment. Exercise also evidences some therapeutic benefit in ED treatment, including preventing loss of bone density, enhancing cognitive functioning, self-regulation, social engagement, and mood regulation, and reducing discomfort during future eating episodes[@achamrahPhysicalActivityPatients2016; @hausenblasCanExerciseTreat2008; @calogeroPracticeProcessHealthy2004]. As a result of the complex relationship between exercise and EDs, more sophisticated research on this phenotype is needed. At present, we know relatively little about the etiology of DEx, including potential genetic influences on the symptom, its relationship to premorbid activity levels, or how to manage this symptom. In addition, we do not understand factors that contribute to the substantial variability in physical activity among those with eating disorders, and why only a portion of individuals present with driven exercise. Given the critical need to improve treatment for individuals with eating disorders, and even more-so for those who engage in driven exercise, improving our understanding of risk for this symptom is paramount.


In the current line of research, we are extend a longitudinal investigation of exercise for weight loss and driven exercise across a larger developmental window (ages 14-24) in the ALSPAC Cohort.

# The ALSPAC Cohort

The ALSPAC Cohort [@boydCohortProfileChildren2013; @fraserCohortProfileAvon2013] was established to understand how genetic and environmental characteristics influence health and development in parents and children. Ethical approval for this study was granted by the ALSPAC Law and Ethics Committee and Local Ethics Committees. All pregnant women living in the geographical area of Avon, United Kingdom, who were expected to deliver between April 1, 1991 and December 31, 1992, were invited to participate in the study. Children from 14,541 pregnancies were enrolled; 13,988 children were alive at 1 year. An additional 913 children were enrolled during subsequent phases of enrollment, with a total sample size alive at 1 year of 14,901. All women gave informed and written consent. Among twin pairs, one twin per pair was randomly excluded from the current study.

# Scoring 

Data cleaning and scoring procedures were completed primarily with the `scorekeeper` R package.

The scorekeeper package is available via github installation [see package documentation]() , and also contains an accompanying [vignette]() and [youtube playlist]() for those getting started with the package. 
Data is scored using scoresheets (.csv files) and an accompanying R script. All scoring described in this data dictionary can be fully replicated by downloading scoresheets from the [scoresheet repository]() associated with this project and running the accompanying R script to score data. If you are attempting to replicate our scoring procedures, please ensure the following: 

1. You are importing your raw data into R using the `haven` package, such that raw data types are 'haven labelled'.

2. Your dataset contains all of the raw variables necessary to complete scoring calculations. If you do not have all raw variables in your dataset, you will need to adjust scoresheets such that raw variables that you do not have are omitted from scoring procedures.

# Eating Disorder Diagnoses

Eating disorder diagnoses (AN, BN,BED, BN-Spectrum [Purging disorder and subclinical BN], BED-spectrum [subclinical BED], and Restrictive spectrum [ED cognitions and restrictive ED behaviors in the absence of regular binge eating, purging, or low weight]) were derived at each age (14, 16, 18, and 24) using best available measures and following steps outlined in @micaliAdolescentEatingDisorders2015, with minor changes (cognitive measures added to criteria as available; subclinical and OSFED categories collapsed to reflect BN, BED, and Restrictive Spectrum ED pathology). Scoring algorithms reflect DSM-5 criteria aligned as well as possible with available data that can be harmonized across assessment points [@americanpsychiatricassociationDiagnosticStatisticalManual2013]. While the majority of cognitive and and behavioral ED features are self-reported, parent-report of restrictive eating was included as an indicator at ages 14 and 16 years as adolescents tend to under-report AN symptoms [@houseDiagnosingEatingDisorders2008]. Table \@ref(fig:alspac-dx-table) outlines full criteria used for each diagnosis in the current project.

```{r alspac-dx-table, fig.cap= 'Diagnostic Criteria Assessed Across Age', out.width = '160%', echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('figs/ALSPAC_Dx_Table.png')
```

***Note***. \* indicates that criteria was not assessed at that timepoint. Criteria thus not required for diagnosis at relevant timepoint. Wt = Weight. AN criteria 'Fear of Gaining Weight' and 'Disturbance in body weight/shape, self-worth influenced by weight and shape, or persistent lack of recognition of seriousness of low body weight' combined as a single indicator due to inconsistent measurement in fear of weight gain and potential for lack of insight amongst youth. At each timepoint, diagnosis was given hierarchically from top to bottom of the table (e.g. if symptoms meeting criteria for AN and BN are both endorsed, AN is the given diagnosis).
