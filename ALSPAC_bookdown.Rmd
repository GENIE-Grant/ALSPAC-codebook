# Data Dictionary for ALSPAC data: K01MH123914

This book contains information on data management and scoring for ALSPAC eating disorder and associated variables, maintained by the [EMBARK Lab](https://embark.psychiatry.wisc.edu). This data dictionary is specifically designed for the project - K01MH123914 - "Driven Exercise in Eating Disorders: A Combined Genetic and Longitudinal Epidemiological Investigation. 

Data in this dictionary represents only variables obtained and cleaned for this project -- the complete set of raw variables available from the ALSPAC cohort can be found in the larger ALSPAC [data dictionary](http://www.bris.ac.uk/alspac/researchers/data-access/data-dictionary/).

# Project Aims

Maladaptive exercise is a common, debilitating symptom across eating disorders (ED). Up to 40% of individuals with bulimia nervosa and 80% of those with anorexia nervosa experience driven exercise. Driven exercise relates to high levels of ED symptoms and poor ED treatment outcomes, and has been purported to be an early ED symptom via retrospective reports. Among those with EDs, maladaptive exercise is associated with: increased risk for suicidal behavior; poor treatment outcome, disorder prognosis, and quality of life[@adamsExerciseDependenceReview1998; @dallegraveCompulsiveExerciseControl2008] obsessive-compulsive traits and symptoms[@shroffFeaturesAssociatedExcessive2006; @davisPrevalenceHighlevelExercise1997; @davisAnorexiaNervosaExcessive2006]; anxiety[@shroffFeaturesAssociatedExcessive2006; @holtkampContributionAnxietyFood2004]; perfectionism[@shroffFeaturesAssociatedExcessive2006]; body dissatisfaction [@brewertonComparisonEatingDisorder1995]; reward dependence[@dallegraveCompulsiveExerciseControl2008]; dietary restraint[@dallegraveCompulsiveExerciseControl2008; @holtkampContributionAnxietyFood2004]; anhedonia [@davisSensitivityRewardingEffects2002]; and hypoleptinemia [@holtkampElevatedPhysicalActivity2003; @holtkampPhysicalActivityRestlessness2006]. Further, maladaptive exercise has been hypothesized to be both compulsive[@meyerCompulsiveExerciseEating2011] and/or addictive [@cookExerciseAddictionCompulsive2014] in nature. 

Preliminary studies suggest a potential role of genetic factors influencing risk for this eating disorder feature. The most recently published genome-wide association study (GWAS) of AN from the Eating Disorders Workgroup of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium demonstrated a positive genetic correlation (*r~g~* = .17) with accelerometer-measured PA [@anorexianervosageneticsinitiativeGenomewideAssociationStudy2019], suggesting that some of the same factors that increase risk for AN are also operative in determining general PA levels. Further, preliminary findings examining polygenic prediction of eating disorder symptoms in the ALSPAC cohort supports the assertion that compulsive predisposition may impact the symptom of driven exercise, specifically. When examining obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and anorexia nervosa (AN) polygenic scores, along with a transdiagnostic OCD/AN polygenic score as predictors of a variety of eating disorder and anxiety-related symtpoms in early-to-mid adolescence, driven exercise was the only eating disorder symptom that was positively predicted (at at least one age and gender time point) by all three polygenic scores[@yilmazPredictingEatingDisorder2022]

Overall, existing research points towards compulsivity and general propensity to exercise as potential risk factors for driven exercise. Further, driven exercise may be an early indicator of high eating disorder risk, as an additional investigation in the ALSPAC cohort found that both exercise for weight loss and driven exercise groups at age 14 were demonstrated higher levels of other ED behaviors (binge eating, fasting, purging) at age 16[@schaumbergProspectiveAssociationsDriven2022].
  

Enhanced understanding of driven exercise is critical as the eating disorder field grapples with designing appropriate interventions for those at risk for, in treatment for, or in remission from eating disorders. High levels of physical activity are frequently associated with positive mental and physical health outcomes[@chekroudAssociationPhysicalExercise2018; @vankimVigorousPhysicalActivity2013; @deslandesExerciseMentalHealth2009], and exercise (planned, structured, repetitive PA)[@caspersenPhysicalActivityExercise1985] is increasingly prescribed as a component of mental health treatment. Exercise also evidences some therapeutic benefit in ED treatment, including preventing loss of bone density, enhancing cognitive functioning, self-regulation, social engagement, and mood regulation, and reducing discomfort during future eating episodes[@achamrahPhysicalActivityPatients2016; @hausenblasCanExerciseTreat2008; @calogeroPracticeProcessHealthy2004]. As a result of the complex relationship between exercise and EDs, more sophisticated research on this phenotype is needed. At present, we know relatively little about the etiology of DEx, including potential genetic influences on the symptom, its relationship to premorbid activity levels, or how to manage this symptom. In addition, we do not understand factors that contribute to the substantial variability in physical activity among those with eating disorders, and why only a portion of individuals present with driven exercise. Given the critical need to improve treatment for individuals with eating disorders, and even more-so for those who engage in driven exercise, improving our understanding of risk for this symptom is paramount.


In the current line of research, we are extend a longitudinal investigation of exercise for weight loss and driven exercise across a larger developmental window (ages 14-24) in the ALSPAC Cohort.

# The ALSPAC Cohort

The ALSPAC Cohort [@boydCohortProfileChildren2013; @fraserCohortProfileAvon2013] was established to understand how genetic and environmental characteristics influence health and development in parents and children. Ethical approval for this study was granted by the ALSPAC Law and Ethics Committee and Local Ethics Committees. All pregnant women living in the geographical area of Avon, United Kingdom, who were expected to deliver between April 1, 1991 and December 31, 1992, were invited to participate in the study. Children from 14,541 pregnancies were enrolled; 13,988 children were alive at 1 year. An additional 913 children were enrolled during subsequent phases of enrollment, with a total sample size alive at 1 year of 14,901. All women gave informed and written consent. Among twin pairs, one twin per pair was randomly excluded from the current study.

# Scoring 

Data cleaning and scoring procedures were completed primarily with the `scorekeeper` R package.

The scorekeeper package is available via github installation [see package documentation]() , and also contains an accompanying [vignette]() and [youtube playlist]() for those getting started with the package. 
Data is scored using scoresheets (.csv files) and an accompanying R script. All scoring described in this data dictionary can be fully replicated by downloading scoresheets from the [scoresheet repository]() associated with this project and running the accompanying R script to score data. If you are attempting to replicate our scoring procedures, please ensure the following: 

1. You are importing your raw data into R using the `haven` package, such that raw data types are 'haven labelled'.

2. Your dataset contains all of the raw variables necessary to complete scoring calculations. If you do not have all raw variables in your dataset, you will need to adjust scoresheets such that raw variables that you do not have are omitted from scoring procedures.

## Body Discrepancy

Body dissatisfaction at age 10.5 years was assessed using gender-appropriate Stunkard figure rating scales (FRS) [@shermanDevelopmentValidationBody1995]. The FRS presents participants with either 5 female or male figures (dependent on the sex of the participant) of different weights and heights and asks which figure the participant most resembles and which figure the participant desires to resemble.

### Scoring

Responses for figures varying in weight were scored as 'very thin', 'thin', 'average', 'fat', or 'very fat' while figures varying in height were scored as 'very short', 'short', 'average', 'tall', or 'very tall'. A body discrepancy score is generated by subtracting the ideal body weight/height chosen from the current perceived body weight/height (higher scores indicate higher body dissatisfaction).

### Key Variables

`body_percept.128` Respondent's perception of his/her body shape at age 10

`body_desire.128` Respondent's desired body shape at age 10

## Thin-ideal Internalization

Thin-ideal internalization at age 14 was assessed using the Ideal-Body Stereotype Scale-Revised (IBSS-R) [@sticeTestDualPathway1996] Girls and boys were both asked six questions, three of which were the same and three of which were gender-specific, assessing the perceived attractiveness of same-sex individuals based on physical characteristics (e.g. being 'lean', 'tall', 'petite').

### Scoring

Items are rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 'Strongly Disagree' (0) to 'Strongly Agree' (4) [@calzoSexualOrientationDisparities2018]. The ten items are averaged to form an overall thin-ideal internalization score.

### Key Variables

`ti_mean.167` Mean thin-ideal internalization score at age 14

`ti_mean.167.na` Percent of variables missing from the thin-ideal internalization measure

## Pressure to Lose Weight/Pressure to Increase Muscle

Pressure to lose weight and to increase muscle were both assessed at age 14 using an adapted version of the Perceived Sociocultural Pressure Scale [@sticeModelingEatingPathology1998]. Participants were asked the extent to which they have felt pressures from friends, family, partners, and the media to lose weight and increase their muscle size. Female participants were only asked about pressures relating to weight while male participants were asked about both pressures relating to weight and muscle.

### Scoring

Response options for both pressure to lose weight and increase muscle were 'Not at all' (1), 'A little' (2), 'Quite a lot' (3), and 'A lot' (4). Scores for each assessment are averaged to form an average score of pressure to lose weight and an average score of pressure to increase muscle.

### Key Variables

`pressure_lose_sum.167` Sum of pressure to lose weight scale at age 14

`pressure_lose_sum.167.na` Percent of variables missing from the pressure to lose weight scale

`pressure_musc_sum.167` Sum of pressure to increase muscle scale at age 14

`pressure_musc_sum.167.na` Percent of variables missing from the pressure to gain muscle scale

## Restrained Eating, External Eating, and Emotional Eating

Restrictive Eating, External Eating, and Emotional Eating were assessed at child age 14 years by the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire (DEBQ) [@vanstrienDutchEatingBehavior1986]. Restrained eating addressed purposefully restricting intake regarding weight concerns. External eating addressed the likelihood of a participant eating due to external stimuli like the sight and smell of the food, regardless of the participant's hunger level. Finally, emotional eating addressed how often the participant ate excessively when they experienced different emotional states.

### Scoring

Depending on the phrasing of the items, responses were either asked on a scale of 'Yes, usually want to eat more' (1), 'Sometimes want to eat more' (2), or 'No, not at all' (3) or on a scale of 'Never' (1), 'Occasionally' (2), 'Sometimes' (3), or 'Frequently' (4). Scores are summed with greater scores indicating a greater likelihood of engagement with restrained eating, external eating, or emotional eating.

### Key Variables

`restraint_sum.167` Sum of the restrained eating items at age 14

`restraint_sum.167.na` Percent of variables missing from the restrained eating subscale

`ext_eat_sum.167` Sum of the external eating items at age 14

`emo_eat_sum.167` Sum of the emotional eating items at age 14

`emo_eat_sum.167.na` Percent of variables missing from the emotional eating subscale

`emo_eat_sum_d.167` Sum of dichotomous responses for emotional eating items

`emo_eat_sum_d.167.na` Percent of variables missing from the dichotomous emotional eating subscale

## Shape and Weight Concern

Shape and Weight concern were assessed at age 14 using items from the McNight Risk Factor Survey, which assesses risk and protective factors for the development of eating disorders in preadolescence and adolescent girls [@shisslakDevelopmentEvaluationMcKnight1999]. The two items taken from the McKnight Survey were:

1.  'In the past year, how happy have you been with the way your body looks?'

2.  'In the past year, how much has your weight made a difference to how you feel about yourself?'

### Scoring

A 4-point Likert scale was used (from 'very unhappy' (1) or 'not at all' (1) to 'very happy' (4) or 'a lot/all the time' (4)) to assess weight and shape concern. The two questions were summed to generate a continuous score.

### Key Variables

`wt_shape_concern.167` Continuous sum of weight and shape concern items at age 14

`wt_shape_concern.167.na` Percent of variables missing from the weight and shape items

## Body Dissatisfaction

Body Dissatisfaction was assessed at ages 14, 18, and 24. An 11-item scale adapted from the satisfaction and dissatisfaction with body parts scale [@sticeProspectiveTestDualpathway2001], which has been used in several previous studies involving the ALSPAC Cohort ([@bornioliAdolescentBodyDissatisfaction2019]; [@bornioliBodyDissatisfactionPredicts2021]; [@schaumbergAnxietyDisorderSymptoms2019]; [@schaumbergProspectiveAssociationsChildhood2021]), was given at Wave 14. Among the 11 items, one item differs between the sexes (satisfaction with 'breasts' is specified for girls and 'build' for boys). Two items address overall body satisfaction with weight and figure, and the remaining items evaluate satisfaction with specific body parts.

Participants were not asked about body satisfaction at age 16. At Wave 18 and 24, participants completed 1 item that addressed happiness levels regarding weight and shape in the past year.

### Scoring

At age 14, responses are graded on a 5-point Likert scale from 'Extremely Satisfied' (1) to 'Extremely Dissatisfied' (5).

At age 18, participants were presented with four responses ranging from 'Very unhappy' (1) to 'Very happy' (4). At age 24, participants were given 5 response options ranging from 'Not at all happy' (1) to 'completely happy' (5).

Body dissatisfaction was scored using the mean of all 11 items, with higher scores indicating greater body dissatisfaction.

### Key Variables

`body_sat_mean.167` Body dissatisfaction mean score at age 14

`body_sat_mean.167.na` Percent of variables missing from the body dissatisfaction measure at age 14

`body_sat.222` How happy respondent has been with way body looks in past year at age 18

`body_sat.288` Degree respondent has been happy with way their body looks or weighs at age 24

## Dieting

Dieting was assessed at ages 14, 16, and 18 years.

To assess dieting, participants were asked a set of questions regarding dieting strategies to lose or keep from gaining weight and actual weight loss in the past year. While these items are original to the ALSPAC study, thesy have been used in multiple studies to assess the overall level of dieting in adolescents [@micaliAdolescentEatingDisorder2015] [@jonesMisreportingEnergyIntake2021]. The question consists of multiple parts with the aim to learn the extent of dieting a respondent has taken part in. The first part of the question aims to find the type of diet(s) and length of time the participant has engaged in said diet(s) and the second part asks about weight lost during the diet and possible weight gain succeeding the diet.

### Scoring

When asked if the participant has gone on a diet in the past year, responses range from 'Always on a diet' (1) to 'never' (5). If respondent selects any answer other than 'never', they are then prompted to respond how long they engaged in the diet(s) ('less than a week', '1-3 weeks', '1-3 months', or '3 or 4 months') and the type of diet(s) they used.

The participant also answers how many pounds they lost while on to the diet(s) and, if they did lose weight, if they gained any of the weight back after the diet ('No, did not regain any of the weight', 'Gained back a little of the weight", 'Gained back most of the weight', 'Gained back all of the weight', or 'put on more than I lost').

### Key Variables

`diet_freq.167` Frequency respondent went on a diet to lose weight or keep from gaining weight during the past year at age 14

`diet_length.167` Length of time respondent was on a diet at age 14

`diet_freq.198` Frequency respondent went on a diet to lose weight or keep from gaining weight during the past year at age 16

`diet_length.198` Length of time respondent was on a diet at age 16

`diet_lost.198` How much weight respondent lost on diet at age 16

`diet_gain.198` How much weight (if any) respondent gained back after diet at age 16

`diet_freq.222` Frequency respondent went on a diet to lose weight or keep from gaining weight during the past year at age 18

`diet_length.222` Length of time respondent was on a diet at age 18

`diet_lost.222` How much weight respondent lost on diet at age 18

`diet_gain.222` How much weight (if any) respondent gained back after diet at age 18

## Fear of Weight Gain

Fear of weight gain was assessed at Wave 14 and Wave 24 via a single item asking the degree to which participants have worried about gaining a little weight (as little as one kilo).

### Scoring

At age 14, participants scored their fear of weight gain on a 4-point Likert response scale: 'Not at all' (1), 'A little' (2), 'A lot' (3), and 'All the time' (4).

At age 24, participants scored their fear of weight gain on a 4-point Likert response scale: 'Not at all' (1), 'A little' (2), 'A lot' (3), and 'Pretty much all the time' (4).

### Key Variables

`fear_wtgain.167` Degree to which respondent has worried about gaining a little weight in the past year at age 14

`fear_wtgain.288` Degree to which respondent has worried about gaining a little weight in the past year at age 24

## Weight Intentions, Perception, and Valuation

Weight intentions, perception, and valuation were all asked with the pretense that there is no correct answer and participants should answer how they think. Weight intentions and perception were assessed at ages 14 and 18 while weight valuation was only asked at age 18.

At both Wave 14 and Wave 18, Weight intentions was assessed in 1 item that asked participants about what they intend to do with their weight. Weight perception asks participants to describe their current weight.

Weight valuation, which was asked at age 18, was also a 1-item question that asked how weight has made a difference in how the participant sees oneself.

### Scoring

Weight intentions was scored using 4 response options: 'I am not trying to do anything about my weight', 'Stay the same', 'Gain weight', or 'Lose weight'.

Weight perception gave a range of 5 responses from 'Very underweight' to 'Very overweight'.

Weight valuation was scored on a 5-point Likert scale from 'Not at all' (1) to 'A lot' (5).

### Key Variables

`wt_intent.167` Respondent's intent with weight at age 14

`wt_perception.167` Description of respondent's current weight at age 14

`wt_intent.222` Respondent's intent with weight at age 18

`wt_perception.222` Description of respondent's current weight at age 18

`wt_valuation.222` Degree to which respondent's weight has made difference to how feel about self in past year at age 18

## Feeling Fat

Individuals were asked at age 24 how often they 'felt fat' in the past year.

### Scoring

Response options were 'Never' (0), 'A little' (1), 'Sometimes' (2), 'A lot' (3), and 'Always' (4).

### Key Variables

`feel_fat.288` How much respondent has 'felt fat' in the past year at age 24

# Eating Disorder Behaviors

Eating Disorder Behaviors Were Assessed at Ages 14, 16, 18, and 24.

Scoring for eating disorder behaviors is completed with a single scoresheet, `ed_behaviors_scoresheet.xlsx`, resulting in a data frame which contains all eating disorder behavior variables, titled `ed_behaviors` in the cleaned dataset.

### Binge Eating

Binge eating behavior was evaluated using questions derived from the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance Scale [@kannYouthRiskBehavior1996] at ages 14, 16, 18, and 24. Questions were adapted to inquire about the previous year [@micaliAdolescentEatingDisorder2015] and have been validated in a sample of adolescents in the Growing Up Today Study [@fieldComparisonSelfreportInterview2004]. Binge Eating Behavior in the ALSPAC data has previously been scored and examined in several papers [@micaliAreObesityRisk2015; @micaliEatingDisorderBehaviours2017; @micaliAdolescentEatingDisorder2015; @schaumbergAnxietyDisorderSymptoms2018; @yilmazPredictingEatingDisorder2022]. At ages 14, 16, and 18, Binge eating was assessed using a two-part question. Participants were first asked about the frequency during the past year of eating a very large amount of food. Those who answered yes were asked a follow-up question that asked whether they felt out of control during these episodes, i.e., whether they could not stop eating even if they wanted to stop, along with five other questions regarding characterization of binge eating episodes (e.g. how often they felt guilty after a binge, how often they ate fast or faster than normal during a binge). Participants who reported any binge eating were then asked to rate five binge eating symptoms (eating faster than normal, stomach hurting or feeling sick, eating large amounts of food, hiding amount eating when on a binge, and feeling guilty after a binge) as to whether they happened never, sometimes, or usually. At age 24, participants were asked how often they went on eating binges in the past year (never, \<1x/mo, 1-3x/mo, 1x/wk, or \>1x/wk), and, if so, whether a period of frequent binge eating lasted at least three months.

### Scoring

Scoring for questions related to binge eating recodes variables to sensible frequencies (e.g. changing a 'no' answer to be represented as '0' with increasing frequency incrementing from zero) and computes dichotomized versions of the presence vs. absence of symptoms for use in symptom counts. Symptom sum scores, which gives a count of the number of binge eating symptoms (0-5) that are present for each individual 'sometimes' or 'usually' at ages 14, 16, and 18 years, are then computed.

Based on the sum score, two additional variables based on the sum score. The first variable computes a variable that notes binge eating is present ('1') if an individual reports binge eating at least once per month with more than two additional symptoms (Subclinical BED criteria met) at ages 14, 16, and 18, and binge eating at least once per month at age 24. The second variable computes a variable that notes full threshold Binge Eating Disorder criteria are met (binge eating weekly plus three or more additional psychological symptoms at 14-18; weekly binge eating lasting three months per more at age 24).

### Key Variables

'x' represents age of assessment for the following variables:

`binge_freq_o.x` - frequency of binge eating at each timepoint

`binge_sx_sum.x` - Number of binge eating psychological symptoms

`binge_sub_criteria_met.x` - dichotomous variable indicating whether subthreshold binge eating disorder symptoms are met

`binge_criteria_met.x` - dichotomous variable indicating whether full threshold binge eating disorder symtpoms are met

## Purging

### Background

Purging was evaluated using questions derived from the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance Scale [@kannYouthRiskBehavior1996] at age 14, 16 and 18. Participants were asked about how often they had made themselves sick or used laxatives in order to control weight or shape in the past year.

### Scoring

### Key Variables

## Dieting/Restriction

### Background

Dieting and restriction was evaluated using questions derived from the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance Scale [@kannYouthRiskBehavior1996] at age 14, 16 and 18. Participants were asked if they had gone on a diet to lose weight or to keep from gaining weight within the past year.

### Scoring

### Key Variables

## Maladpative Exercise

Questions related to maladaptive exercise were self-reported at ages 14, 16, 18, and 24 years. Questions were adapted from the Youth Risk Behavior Survelliance System [@kannYouthRiskBehavior1995].

#### Exercise for Weight Loss

At ages 14, 16, and 18 years, participants were asked if they exercised to lose weight or avoid gaining weight, with response options of: No(0), Yes-Sometimes(1), and Yes-Frequently(2).

At age 24, participants were asked the frequency with which they exercised to lose weight or avoid gaining weight, with response options of: Never, \<1x/mo, 1-3x/mo, 1-4x/wk, and 5 or more times per week. For the purposes of analysis, responses at age 24 were harmonized with age 14, 16, and 18. Responses of Never were binned as "No" (0); 1x/mo - \<1x/week were binned as 'Yes - Sometimes'(1), and 1x/wk or more as 'Yes - Frequently'(2). Once a week or more was chosen as the threshold for 'frequent' exercise for weight loss at age 24 to align with DSM-V diagnostic frequency thresholds for other eating disorder behaviors, such as binge eating and purging [@americanpsychiatricassociationDiagnosticStatisticalManual2013]. The primary derived outcome variable of analysis for exercise for weight loss is an ordinal variable, defined as 0 = No, 1 = Sometimes, and 2 = Frequently.

#### Maladaptive Exercise Indicators

Issues that are associated with exercise were also reported at ages 14,16, 18, and 24 years. At all assessment points, participants reported whether exercise interferes with work/school (14,16,18), or their daily routine (24). At ages 14 and 24, participants also reported whether they exercised to lose weight even when sick or injured. At ages 16 and 18 years, participants reported whether they felt guilty about missing an exercise session -- see Table \@ref(tab:tab2) . Responses options for exercise issues were 'No', 'yes - Sometimes', or 'Yes - Frequently'.

### Key Variables

```{r tab2}
x <- tibble(Age = c(14,16,18,24), Interferes = c('x','x','x','x'), Sick_Injured = c('x',' ',' ', 'x'), Guilt = c('' ,'x','x', '')) 

kableExtra::kbl(x, caption = 'Exercise Issues Assessed at Each Age') %>% 
  kableExtra::kable_styling()
```

Exercise issues are deemed to be 'present' at each time point if an individual endorses: (1) exercise interfering with work/school sometimes or more OR frequent guilt when missing an exercise session at ages 16 and 18 years and (2) exercise interfering with work/school/daily routine sometimes or more OR exercising even when sick/injured sometimes or more at ages 14 and 24 years.

The presence of maladaptive exercise in this study was defined as exercising for weight loss **sometimes or frequently** and at least one **exercise issue** defined as present at each time point. Frequency of exercise for weight loss as sometimes or more was chosen for this definition as (1) existing literature suggests that frequency of exercise may be less important than cognitive features in defining exercise risk in the context of eating disorders [@adkinsDoesExcessiveCompulsive2005; @mondUpdateDefinitionExcessive2006] and (2) the nature of the epidemiological sample and the concomitant goals of this paper are such that we are interested in identifying early risk indicators, which may be best captured via a broad (vs. narrow) definition of maladaptive exercise. The primary variable to define maladaptive exercise was derived as described, resulting in a dichotomous outcome (0 = Absent, 1 = Present).

#### Exercise Groups

Exercise groups over time are defined for descriptive analyses and transition states, replicating groups defined in @schaumbergProspectiveAssociationsDriven2022. Those who report no exercise for weight loss at each time point are placed in a 'No Exercise for Weight Loss' group, those who report exercise for weight loss at least sometimes, but do not meet criteria for maladaptive exercise are placed in an 'Exercise for Weight Loss' group, and those meeting maladaptive exercise criteria are placed in the 'Maladaptive Exercise' group.

## Fasting

### Background

Fasting was evaluated using questions derived from the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance Scale [@kannYouthRiskBehavior1996] at age 14, 16 and 18. Participants reported their frequency of fasting to lose or avoid gaining weight. Participants that endorsed any fasting at age 14, 16, or 18 were coded as coded as 'yes' to fasting for weight loss.

# Eating Disorder Diagnoses

Eating disorder diagnoses (AN, BN,BED, BN-Spectrum [Purging disorder and subclinical BN], BED-spectrum [subclinical BED], and Restrictive spectrum [ED cognitions and restrictive ED behaviors in the absence of regular binge eating, purging, or low weight]) were derived at each age (14, 16, 18, and 24) using best available measures and following steps outlined in @micaliAdolescentEatingDisorders2015, with minor changes (cognitive measures added to criteria as available; subclinical and OSFED categories collapsed to reflect BN, BED, and Restrictive Spectrum ED pathology). Scoring algorithms reflect DSM-5 criteria aligned as well as possible with available data that can be harmonized across assessment points [@americanpsychiatricassociationDiagnosticStatisticalManual2013]. While the majority of cognitive and and behavioral ED features are self-reported, parent-report of restrictive eating was included as an indicator at ages 14 and 16 years as adolescents tend to under-report AN symptoms [@houseDiagnosingEatingDisorders2008]. Table \@ref(fig:alspac-dx-table) outlines full criteria used for each diagnosis in the current project.

```{r alspac-dx-table, fig.cap= 'Diagnostic Criteria Assessed Across Age', out.width = '160%', echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('figs/ALSPAC_Dx_Table.png')
```

***Note***. \* indicates that criteria was not assessed at that timepoint. Criteria thus not required for diagnosis at relevant timepoint. Wt = Weight. AN criteria 'Fear of Gaining Weight' and 'Disturbance in body weight/shape, self-worth influenced by weight and shape, or persistent lack of recognition of seriousness of low body weight' combined as a single indicator due to inconsistent measurement in fear of weight gain and potential for lack of insight amongst youth. At each timepoint, diagnosis was given hierarchically from top to bottom of the table (e.g. if symptoms meeting criteria for AN and BN are both endorsed, AN is the given diagnosis).

# Anthropometric Variables

Anthropometric variables were collected and/or reported at several time points during development.

## Body Mass Index (BMI)

Body Mass Index (BMI) was assessed throughout development, with 16 objective, clinic-based assessment points from ages 2-24 years, and 9 self-report or parent-report assessments of height and weight throughout puberty (ages 8-18). Table \@ref(tab:BMI-table) provides information on specific variables and assessment timepoints.

```{r BMI-table, echo=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(kableExtra)
BMI_vars <- readxl::read_excel('BMI_variables.xlsx')
kbl(BMI_vars, caption = 'BMI-related variables across assessment points') %>% 
kable_styling() 
```

## Scoring

For scoring purposes, all raw variables are included in cleaned data (renamed to follow appropriate naming conventions), along with derived variables which compute BMIz scores based on 2000 WHO reference data for all time points (including self-reported data). A 'best available' BMI (and accompanying BMIz score) within the past year at target ages 11.0, 14.0, 16.0, and 18.0 is also calculated. This 'best available' BMI data uses clinic data when available and self/parent-report data if clinic data is not available. This approach is used to maximize accuracy and coverage of data when BMI at a specified age is to be used for eating disorder diagnosis and/or employed as an analytic predictor.

## Key Variables

BMIz scores prior to age 18 are noted as:

`BMIz_clinic.X` Objective obtained BMI at clinic where X = age in months at time when assessment was targeted to be completed, rounded to one tenth. 

`BMIz_sr.X` BMIz obtained by self- or parent-reported height and weight where X = age in months at time when assessment was targeted to be completed.

# Physical Activity

## Free-living activity

Objective physical activity data was captured using Actigraph^tm^ accelerometers at child ages 11.5, 13.5 and 15.5 years. Youth were instructed to wear accelerometers around the waist just above their right hip for the duration of a 7 day tracking period, beginning the day after clinic attendance [@mattocksUseAccelerometersLarge2008]. At age 24 participants were asked to wear accelerometers for four days after clinic attendance [@troianoPhysicalActivityUnited2008]. Valid Days are calculated using a cutoff of minutes per day that an accelerometer was worn. For ages 11.5-15.5 a cutoff of \>=600 minutes per day was used. At age 24 Valid Days were operationalised as a wear time of at least 500 minutes, after excluding intervals of \>60 minutes with zero counts.

#### Activity Counts Per Minute (CPM)

Total physical activity was measured as the total counts per minute (CPM) over the period of valid recording. Associations with total physical activity are usually calculated per 100 cpm as this difference is of a similar order to the differences observed between males and females in these data.

#### Moderate-to-Vigorous Physical Activity (MVPA)

MVPA measures the average amount of time spent above a CPM cutoff, which differs across age. At ages 11.5, 13.5 and 15.5 A value of \>= 3600 CPM was originally used to define MVPA at the time of the data collection [@mattocksUseAccelerometersLarge2008]. More recently, following Evenson et. al. [@evensonCalibrationTwoObjective2008], who calculated a lower cutpoint of \>=2296. Both sets of data were included in analysis. At age 24 MVPA cutoff was established at \>2020 cpm [@troianoPhysicalActivityUnited2008].
