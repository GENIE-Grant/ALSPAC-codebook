# Introduction

Maladaptive exercise is a serious, concerning, and understudied eating disorder feature associated with: increased risk for suicidal behavior; poor treatment outcome, disorder prognosis, and quality of life; [@adamsExerciseDependenceReview1998; @dallegraveCompulsiveExerciseControl2008] obsessive-compulsive traits and symptoms;23,27,28 anxiety;23,29 perfectionism;23 body dissatisfaction;30 reward dependence;22 dietary restraint;22,29 anhedonia;31 and hypoleptinemia.32,33 While research on this eating disorder feature is limited, DEx has been hypothesized to be both compulsive28,34 and addictive.35-38 Further, a recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) of AN demonstrated a positive genetic correlation (r~g~ = .17) with accelerometer-measured PA,39 suggesting that some of the same factors that increase risk for AN are also operative in determining general PA levels. Overall, existing research points towards compulsivity and general propensity to exercise as potential risk factors for DEx. At present, our understanding of the developmental etiology of DEx is poor, and the extent to which this eating disorder feature relates to patterns of PA during development is unknown.

Enhanced understanding of DEx is critical as this field grapples with designing appropriate PA interventions for those at risk for, in treatment for, or in remission from EDs. High levels of PA are frequently associated with positive mental and physical health outcomes,17-19 and exercise (planned, structured, repetitive PA)40 is increasingly prescribed as a component of mental health treatment.4 Among individuals with EDs, however, a considerable number of patients present with hyperactivity and the feature of DEx (exercising in a compulsive manner to influence weight and shape35,41,42). DEx is associated with multiple indices of poor outcome and ED complications (e.g. worse disorder prognosis;22,26 higher body dissatisfaction30 and dietary restraint;22,29 hypoleptinemia;32,33 higher rates of suicidal behavior25). Given the high frequency of DEx among those with EDs (\>40% across restrictive-spectrum EDs),22,23 identifying exercise recommendations that support mental and physical health in the context of ED risk and recovery is challenging.43 While recommendations to stop exercise are appropriate under acute conditions related to medical risk, this prescription is not universally useful. Exercise evidences some therapeutic benefit in ED treatment, including preventing loss of bone density, enhancing cognitive functioning, self-regulation, social engagement, and mood regulation, and reducing discomfort during future eating episodes.43-45 As a result of the complex relationship between exercise and EDs, more sophisticated research on this phenotype is needed. At present, we know relatively little about the etiology of DEx, its relationship to premorbid activity levels, or how to manage this symptom. In addition, we do not understand factors that contribute to the substantial variability in PA among those with EDs, and why only a portion of individuals present with DEx. Given the critical need to improve treatment for individuals with EDs, and even more-so for those who engage in DEx,18 improving our understanding of risk for this symptom is paramount.

Driven exercise (DEx) is a common, debilitating symptom across eating disorders (ED). Up to 40% of individuals with bulimia nervosa and 80% of those with anorexia nervosa experience driven exercise. Driven exercise relates to high levels of ED symptoms and poor ED treatment outcomes, and has been purported to be an early ED symptom via retrospective reports.

A previous study examined exercise for weight loss and driven exercise at age 14 in the ALSPAC cohort, identifying whether groups at age 14 were associated with ED behaviors at ages 14 and 16 [@schaumbergProspectiveAssociationsDriven2022]. Results found that both exercise for weight loss and driven exercise groups at age 14 were demonstrated higher levels of other ED behaviors (binge eating, fasting, purging) at age 16.

In the current line of research, we are extend a longitudinal investigation of exercise for weight loss and driven exercise across a larger developmental window (ages 14-24) in the ALSPAC Cohort.
